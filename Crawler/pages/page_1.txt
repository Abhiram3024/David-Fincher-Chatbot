David Fincher


	David Fincher (born Aug. 28, 1962) is an American filmmaker known for directing psychological thrillers. His movies have collectively grossed over $2.1 billion worldwide and have racked up 40 Oscar nominations. Fincher has won four Emmy awards, two Grammys and a Golden Globe. His feature debut was 1992’s “Alien 3,” the third installment in the science fiction series, which he followed up with the Brad Pitt-starring “Se7en,” a detective thriller that reached over $327 million at the global box office. Fincher reunited with Pitt for 1999’s “Fight Club,” also starring Edward Norton, and 2008’s “The Curious Case of Benjamin Button.” The director has often helmed movies based on books, adapting novels in “The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo” and “Gone Girl” and nonfiction books with “Zodiac” and “The Social Network,” which chronicles the creation of Facebook, and the fallout of its founders. His latest film, “The Killer,” is an action thriller starring Michael Fassbender as an assassin who finds himself at the center of an international manhunt after a job goes awry. Fincher has also dabbled in television, executive producing “House of Cards” and directing seven episodes of the Netflix thriller show “Mindhunter.” He’s also credited as an EP on the sci-fi anthology series “Love, Death & Robots” and directed the episode “Bad Travelling.” Before he became an established auteur, Fincher directed dozens of music videos dating back to 1984, through his production company Propaganda Films. Fincher worked with artists ranging from the Rolling Stones (“Love Is Strong”) to Michael Jackson (“Who Is It”) to Madonna (“Express Yourself”) to Justin Timberlake and Jay-Z (“Suit & Tie”).
