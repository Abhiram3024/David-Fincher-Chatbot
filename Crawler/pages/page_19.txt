Director David Fincher Takes On The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo

A few months ago, David Fincher was having a problem with his new movie. This in itself wasn’t especially surprising, as Fincher’s productions seem to attract crises of the cosmic-joke variety, be they midshoot injuries (Se7en), last-minute casting switcheroos (Panic Room), or on-the-fly script rewrites (Alien3). Despite the director’s meticulous planning—he can spend years preparing for a film—something usually goes awry. He’s used to it. “All movies are a trial,” he says matter-of-factly. “It’s war.”
But this latest battle was unique. In a roundabout way, it had to do with ABBA.
For much of the past year, Fincher has been filming The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, his roughly $100 million adaptation of the macabre Swedish mystery that centers on a punk-hacker heroine with distinctive skin art. On one of the first nights of shooting, Fincher and his crew were in Sweden, filming a murder scene that takes place alongside a gloomy dock. But after a night’s work, Fincher didn’t have the shot he wanted, and the film’s ultratight schedule meant he wouldn’t be able to return for months.
When Fincher began planning the reshoot, he learned that the property had been sold to one of the guys in ABBA. Apparently, the new owner—either Benny or Björn, it’s not really clear—wasn’t thrilled at the prospect of having his evening stroll interrupted by a simulated drowning, and he refused to let the crew come back. Rather than find a new location or make do with the footage he had, Fincher decided to build his own Swedish dock.
Which is why, on a late-summer afternoon, we’re standing on a Los Angeles soundstage, examining a replica of a rural-Scandinavia mise-en-scène: mossy rocks, foliage-fat trees, and—perched high above the docks, turtlenecking out of the woods—a squat, deceptively cozy faux cottage. Like most sets, it looks a bit weird naked. But once the lights hit and the smoke drifts in, we are suddenly in the land of stunted summers and moderately high suicide rates.
The mass murder and hate-sex in Dragon Tattoo is proof that your mom has been reading some weird stuff lately.
As usual, though, Fincher is not satisfied. He stands in the middle of the stage, arms folded, a coffee stirrer clenched in his teeth. He’s 49 and trim, dressed in dark jeans, a gray polo, and sneakers, his mouth framed by a neat turf of mostly salty salt-and-pepper whiskers. He then starts pacing the set, calmly relaying what needs to be changed, tune-ups that range from the subtle to the barely perceptible: a branch that’s sagging a few inches too low; a pair of lightbulbs with mismatched wattages; a patch of leaves that needs to be a little bit darker.
Most viewers won’t notice the way the pebbles are scattered or how high the watermarks rise on the fake rocks. But Fincher will. Even in an industry full of control freaks, Fincher stands out as obsessive—a guy who will scrutinize and engineer every element in the frame until the images on the screen fit the ones in his head. Sometimes that means repainting a few leaves; sometimes it means doing 50, 60, even 100 takes of a single scene.
Dragon Tattoo is Fincher’s ninth film in two decades. And while the movies often focus on dark-hearted subjects—madness (Se7en), paranoia (The Game), nihilism (Fight Club), greed (Panic Room), obsession (Zodiac), and betrayal (The Social Network)—they’re always beautiful to look at. Each is packed with so much careful detail—physical, aural, spatial—while also being so clean and composed that he’s earned his own fanboy-bestowed sobriquet: Fincheresque.

Like middle class and pornography, the term is know-it-when-you-see-it elastic, but it’s usually pinned on a scene that’s darkly lit, darkly themed, and eerily beautiful. Think of the flashlights sabering through a shut-in’s filthy apartment in Se7en or the skyscrapers exploding and folding like glass accordions at the end of Fight Club.
Moments like these have established Fincher as one of Hollywood’s few accessible auteurs, a guy who can make commercially viable movies without 2s in their title and who never sacrifices his artful cynicism for phony uplift. “There aren’t a whole lot of directors trying to find the balance between commerce and—loath as I am to say it—art,” Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker says. “Somehow, he manages to make something incredibly handcrafted and heartfelt on a big budget.”
But Fincher’s bleak yet captivating visions might also be why, despite all his success, he’s never had an Inception-size box-office smash. Even a movie like Se7en, which pulled in $300 million worldwide, had the aura of a cult hit, if only because it felt weird to enthuse openly about a movie in which a pregnant woman’s decapitated head is stuffed into a box. “My whole career has been pervy books, pervy scripts,” Fincher says, only half kidding. “It wasn’t so much about finding a niche. It just didn’t seem to me like there was any need to be doing more of what everyone else was doing.” It’s not that Fincher’s films aren’t beloved—they are—it’s just that sometimes it take a while for audiences to come around to them. It’s as if Fincher lives in the near future, releasing movies a year or two before the world is ready for them.

It wasn’t until The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in 2008 and The Social Network in 2010 that Fincher made what could truly be called mass-market films. While neither was exactly upbeat—Benjamin Button is the story of a man aging in reverse, and The Social Network‘s IPOs-before-bros maneuverings and legal takedowns were as brutal as anything in Fight Club—they were audience-pleasing efforts, and both earned Fincher Oscar nominations for best director.
Now, with Dragon Tattoo, Fincher is going further, plugging into a presold, globally recognizable mega-property. Stieg Larsson’s densely written (in every sense of the word) yet hard-to-put-down thriller follows a disgraced journalist (played by Daniel Craig) and an outcast hacker (The Social Network‘s Rooney Mara) as they team up to investigate a 40-year-old missing-persons case. Before it’s over, they’ll have discovered a warped fiefdom of mass murder and hate-sex and you’ll have discovered that your mom has been reading some really weird shit lately.
In many ways, Dragon Tattoo is the biggest movie of Fincher’s career. It’s the first time since his debut—Alien3—that he has committed himself to a fanatically awaited pop-culture property; Larsson’s novels are easily the most feverishly devoured books since the Twilight series. If the movie works, Fincher could very well be looking at his first franchise, not to mention a third Oscar nomination. (Sony optioned Craig and Mara for the second and third installments, though Fincher hasn’t been announced yet as their director.) Most important, the movie could finally nudge Fincher into the realm of Spielberg and Scorsese—bankable filmmakers who can define and mine the zeitgeist simultaneously and who get to do whatever they want. And for Fincher, getting to do whatever he wants is worth going to war for.
I meet Fincher at a very strange time in his life, in part because he’s allowing me to meet him at all. Even as Se7en and The Game became hits in the mid- to late ’90s—right around the time when directors like Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson were becoming auteur superstars—Fincher kept a determinedly low profile. “I don’t enjoy doing interviews, because I don’t like being part of the noise,” he tells me one afternoon as we drive between Dragon Tattoo‘s LA sets. “I just don’t want to be grist for the mill.”
In person, Fincher is casually friendly. He says “dude” and “peace” more than you’d expect, and says “fuck” about as often as you’d expect, considering he’s trying to get a massively expensive tent-pole movie into theaters by Christmas. And, like his films, Fincher is unexpectedly, almost disruptively funny; at one point, while scouting a new location in LA, he dryly jokes that private trailers will be needed for the actors, because of Craig’s chronic masturbation habit. (Craig, for his part, calls the director “very witty. It’s a valve that needs letting off, especially when you’re doing scenes about anal rape.”)
As a result of Fincher’s low visibility—and perhaps this was partly intended—he has maintained a sort of scary-wunderkind mystique. The few known facts about the director make him seem such an unbelievable prodigy that even today they are like the stuff of fan fiction: that he lived down the street from George Lucas. Or that he skipped college and found a job at Industrial Light & Magic, working on movies like Return of the Jedi. Or that, by his early twenties, he was already overseeing video shoots with major-label budgets and giant crews.
But it all happened. And when you look at how Fincher grew up—in Marin County, California, in the early ’70s—suddenly it’s hard to imagine it not happening. By then, so many directors had set up shop in the San Francisco area—Lucas, Francis Ford Coppola, Philip Kaufman (Invasion of the Body Snatchers), Michael Ritchie (The Candidate)—that filmmaking seemed like a plausible, even admirable career path. “None of the kids in my neighborhood wanted to be doctors or lawyers,” he says. “They all wanted to be moviemakers.”
Fincher’s father was an author and a bureau chief for Life magazine; his mother was a mental-health nurse who worked in a methadone clinic. At home, they’d discuss their work with Fincher. “My parents didn’t keep much from me,” he says. “They were like, ‘Here’s the world you’re going out into.'”
They also encouraged their son to follow his singular, precociously realized goal: to make movies. In the third grade, Fincher was already taking an elementary-school film class; a few years later, he was directing super-8 movies with his friends. Figuring film school would be a waste of time, he worked his way into a job at ILM in 1982, when he was 20. “He knew what he wanted,” remembers Terry Chostner, an ILM vet who was on staff with Fincher. “He kept telling people he was going to be a director. And this from a kid who wasn’t even drinking age.”
Fincher made his transition to directing by moving to LA to work in the nascent (and largely looked-down-upon) music-video industry. One of his earliest efforts was Rick Springfield’s “Bop ‘Til You Drop,” a Mad Max-cribbing, dystopic-Jazzercise fantasy that involved slave labor, alien overlords, and laser beams. Though the clip’s ominous story line was completely incongruous with the song’s pro-bop message, the video established many of the hallmarks of Fincher’s early director-for-hire career: light-bathed visuals, budget-straining production values, and a linear if only quasi-logical narrative.
Fincher didn’t have much love for music videos, and he especially loathed doing commercials (and still does, though sometimes he will make one)—”they’re awful,” he says, “and they involve all sorts of bizarre, bureaucratic checks and balances”—but each assignment got him one step closer to making movies, and the money was spectacular.

After cofounding the famed production company Propaganda Films (which went on to produce works by directors from Michael Bay to Spike Jonze), Fincher directed dozens of clips throughout the ’80s and early ’90s, each increasingly daring and expensive: Madonna’s “Express Yourself,” a sweat-glistened, rain-soaked homage to Fritz Lang’s Metropolis; Aerosmith’s “Janie’s Got a Gun,” a disturbing child-abuse tale with a police-procedural story line; and Don Henley’s “The End of the Innocence,” a crisp black-and-white portrait of Reagan-era hardship, influenced by photographer Robert Frank’s famed ’50s travelogue, The Americans. “There’s always been a deep humanism to David’s work,” says director Greg Gold, one of Propaganda’s founders. “Even the characters in his music videos had depth.”
Fincher’s Propaganda duties often required him to deal with label brass and ad agencies, something he didn’t enjoy, particularly when they got in the way of his ideas. An ad exec might show up at a Fincher shoot and find out he was banned from his own set. Nosy record-label employees were circumvented or simply ignored. “He was opinionated and difficult,” says Sigurjón Sighvatsson, another of Propaganda’s founders. “But he wasn’t arrogant. He was confident.” Kim Dempster, who helped produce several of Fincher’s early projects, remembers the shoots as being “extremely stressful. You had to have it together for him. It was much harder than working for other directors, but it was a much better product.”
When I mention an early ’90s Advertising Age article about his supposed strong-headedness, Fincher dismisses the claim—though he doesn’t exactly deny it, either. “You’re supposed to have an idea of what it is you’re trying to do, right?” he says. “Aren’t you being overpaid to have that? My job is to know what the fuck I want.”
Fincher’s headquarters is a neatly outfitted modernist building in Los Angeles’ Little Armenia district. Inside his office, there’s a Where the Wild Things Are  skateboard, a massive coffee table book dedicated to Stanley Kubrick’s never-filmed Napoleon biopic, and a Segway. On his desk is a black-and-white printout of a scantily clad Mara, the actress playing the hacker in Dragon Tattoo, with a computer mouse covering her genitals. Fincher wonders if it might work to illustrate this story.
“What are your bosses like?” he asks. “Are they corporate suck-asses afraid of their own shadow?”
At first, it might seem odd that Fincher would still be raging at corporate suck-assery: His advertising clients have included such behemoths as AT&T and Levi’s, and unlike many of his contemporaries—Steven Soderbergh, David O. Russell—he’s never made a movie outside of the studio system. He has certainly been well compensated by the corporate fat cats he claims to loathe; at one point in the mid-’80s, he says, Propaganda was billing nearly $80 million a year. Undoubtedly, a reasonable portion of that ended up in his pocket.
Perhaps Fincher clings to his deep antiauthority streak because it has always served as a crucial motivator—almost a muse. It started back in grade school, when he bristled at the idea of being required to study nonfilm subjects, and it continued through his video and commercial career. “He was always a rebel,” Propaganda’s Sighvatsson says. “He was always fighting with somebody, whether it was the establishment or whatever. Always challenging the status quo.”
But whatever animosity Fincher harbored toward corporate power was surely cemented by his experiences making Alien3. Released in 1992, Fincher’s first movie tells the story of Sigourney Weaver’s beloved Ripley character being stranded in an all-male outer space penal colony, where she shaves her head, learns she’s pregnant with an alien, and eventually kills herself by falling, slow motion, into a giant vat of molten lava. Alien3 was pounded by critics and largely ignored by audiences; the only way it could have done worse would have been if they’d actually called it All-Male Outer Space Penal Colony.
Fincher hates talking about Alien3, which started filming without a finished script and plunged him into daily battles with 20th Century Fox over control (in the end, the studio recut Fincher’s version). “At midnight, he’d have to get on the phone with Fox and justify shooting the next day’s work,” remembers Weaver. “I think it hurt his feelings and was exhausting.”
Several years later, Fincher made nice with Fox and somehow persuaded the studio to bankroll Fight Club, his caustic, anticorporate buddy comedy about an unnamed, culturally emasculated claims adjuster (Edward Norton) and a charismatic anarchist named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who form an underground brawling league/terrorist co-op. Adapted from a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club was grotesquely violent, unnervingly kinetic, and darkly funny. The mere existence of Fight Club is kind of a joke—a treatise on the neutering effects of corporate America, underwritten by an international media conglomerate. “We were making a satire,” Fincher says. “We were saying, ‘This is as serious about blowing up buildings as The Graduate is about fucking your mom’s friend.'”
Released in 1999, the movie caused a bipartisan freak-out: Conservatives condemned its violence, while Hollywood liberals complained that it focused unwanted attention on shoot-’em-up films and TV in the months following Columbine. For Fincher, this was all a point of pride. “There’s a quote from a film critic that David had enlarged, framed, and hung in his conference room,” says Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin. “It calls Fight Club ‘amoral and Godless.’ I think he’d rather have that quote than a Palme d’Or.”
Though Fight Club was only a modest success in theaters, it has sold millions of DVDs. Watch the movie now and it’s easy to see why: Fight Club has yet to age; indeed, its time may still not have truly arrived. The movie addressed build-your-life-around-our-brand consumerism well before the cult of the iPod was founded, and it provided an inadvertent blueprint for the sort of decentralized, shits-and-giggles anarchy that would later be adopted by web collectives like Anonymous. When people watch it 50 years from now, they’ll probably assume it was made in 2011 or 2021 or whatever bleak period it will have turned out to presage.
Fight Club also exemplifies Fincher’s curious relationship with the modern era: It’s a movie about the perils of IKEA furniture and luxe gadgetry, directed by a Segway-riding gearhead. This is a paradox that runs through Fincher’s life and work. He’s a director raised on CG who’s known for embracing new techniques and effects, from the reverse-aging wizardry in Benjamin Button to the subtle Winklevoss head-swaps in The Social Network. Yet Fincher has never been sucked too deeply into the whimsy-indulging, physics- bending cartoon rabbit hole of CGI that has engulfed directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas. And while his characters are frequently analytical brainiacs (hackers, coders, claims adjusters), they’re often also prisoners of modernity.
Consider Panic Room, in which Jodie Foster’s character takes refuge inside a Sharper Image-indebted, high tech steel sarcophagus. Or  The Social Network, which contrasted Mark Zuckerberg’s frictionless online communication with his fractured real-life friendships. Even the solitary, decades-long hunt for a serial killer in Zodiac can be seen as a cautionary tale about informational fixation—an allegorical warning for the Internet age, when a time-suck can become a life-suck without your even noticing. In Fincher’s world, the innovations that safeguard and enrich us are also the ones that do us in.
Back on the set of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo, Mara’s angry-hacker character, Lisbeth, is having her way with a treacherous Swede, courtesy of an imposingly huge chrome vibrator with a serrating buzz that sounds less like a joy machine than an irked Taser. This is Fincher’s third attempt at the book’s infamous rape-revenge scene, one of the key plot points in Larsson’s story.
As it turns out, I’m not supposed to be here: Because the scene is so intense, this is a closed set—limited to essential cast and crew only. Before walking me in, Fincher makes me promise not to tell Mara I’m on set, then promptly finds me a seat right next to hers. I can’t help but wonder if it’s a semiplayful attempt to unnerve me. He denies this later, though I’m not sure I believe him. (“He is quite mischievous,” Mara says a few weeks afterward, laughing. “But we were all pretty desensitized at that point.”)
Fincher thought film school would be a waste of time. Instead of going to college, he worked his way into a job at ILM.
The relatively at-ease atmosphere on the Dragon Tattoo set is surprising, not only because of the subject matter but because stories of Fincher’s endurance-test directing style are legendary: How he made Jake Gyllenhaal perform in Zodiac with a high fever; how he put Mara and Jesse Eisenberg through more than 90 takes of The Social Network‘s opening breakup scene. “Challenging people,” Mara says, “is one of his greatest joys in life.”
Fincher’s reasoning for putting his actors and crew through so many takes is simple: Making a movie requires flying people thousands of miles, putting them up in hotels, and spending days building sets. What’s the point of all that preparation if you’re just going to do your scene three times?
As grueling as it might seem to work under Fincher, he inspires loyalty among many of his actors and crew members. Rigidity, after all, also doubles as structure. “When you’re working with somebody you trust, there’s a really nice feeling of just submitting to their goals,” says Eisenberg, who got an Oscar nomination for his role in The Social Network.
This confidence isn’t limited to actors. “He really is the best technician I’ve ever worked with, ever,” says Jodie Foster, who has directed four films. “He knows more about making movies than anybody I’ve ever met. He pretty much knows everybody else’s job better than they do.”
Still, at times Fincher has played God a bit too ferociously. At one point while filming Panic Room—a production so tense, according to Fincher’s DVD commentary, that some people freaked out and needed to be escorted off the set (Fincher won’t get into specifics)—Foster stood with him behind a monitor, watching him agonize over each take. “He looked at me, and he was like, ‘I just don’t know anymore,'” she says. “I’m like, ‘You know what? I usually see what you’re going for. This time, I don’t see the difference between take two and take seven.’ And he’s like, ‘Oh my God. I’m crazy, aren’t I?’ He recognizes it. He knows he has an issue. But he has to be 100 percent comfortable with the scene.”
Fortunately perhaps for Fincher’s current cast members, there hasn’t been quite as much time for such micromanaging on Dragon Tattoo. It’s his fourth film in five years, and it came together rather quickly—surprising, given its many ostensible obstacles. For starters, there’s the fact that film versions of Larsson’s three Girl books have already been produced in Sweden and are readily available on Netflix. And the movie came with an unwigglable holiday-season deadline.
There was also the material itself, a return to the gritty settings of Fincher’s early career. “I try to choose things that aren’t a rehash of places I’ve been,” he says. “But I liked the idea of these two people navigating this odd world thousands of miles away. That was more interesting to me than the notion of ‘Oh look, more depravity.'”
And hooooo boy, is the Dragon Tattoo book depraved (sample sentence: “The killer concluded his barbarities by shoving a parakeet up her vagina.”) It’s also unevenly written. For the first 100 pages or so, it’s almost impossible to believe Larsson’s series has become a top choice for book-clubbers and frequent-fliers around the world.
But oddly enough, once you finish it you can’t wait to see the movie. Maybe it’s the animosity-flecked charge between the lead characters or the monstrous (yet recognizably human) villainy or the way it makes computer hacking seem like such a weirdly sexy calling. There’s something undeniably dank and alluring about Dragon Tattoo, something almost … Fincheresque. With its sunless settings, multipronged cruelty, and emotionally bruised tech addicts, it’s impossible to imagine any other director making it.
In fact, Larsson’s gruesome work might never have found such a huge audience if Fincher hadn’t long ago snipped off our eyelids and shown us the entrenched nastiness around us. Fifteen years earlier he would have had to fight to make a film as twisted as Dragon Tattoo; now it’s set to be a holiday blockbuster. David Fincher’s future, it seems, has finally arrived.
It’s an early morning in Hollywood, and Fincher is listening to the words of a ghost:
“If a dove is the sinner’s offering, the priest shall wring off its head, cleave its wings, and burn it upon the altar.”
We’re in a sound studio where dialog for Dragon Tattoo is being recorded. In the corner of the room, standing at a microphone, is Moa Garpendal, a fair-skinned, long-stemmed Swedish actress who plays Harriet, the teenager whose mysterious disappearance sets Dragon Tattoo in motion. As she reads the line—a short bit of voice-over that appears halfway through the story—Fincher paces the floor, making eye contact only when he has a suggestion.
“A little more finality at the end,” he says. “Bring your voice down.”
She gives it another reading. “Let’s do one more,” Fincher says. “Read it like a recipe. ‘If you do this, then you have to do this, then this.'”
More tries, more notes.
“Give me a little more ‘wring off and cleave,’ just to make it more punitive.”
“Try to make the inhale a little bit softer.”
“Good. Do one more.”
Sometimes, Fincher raises his glasses and pinches his eyes closed, shutting out everything but the sound. Whatever he’s listening for this morning, whatever way the words fall together in his head, will not be arrived at quickly. At one point, he catches a noise deep in the background of the track and halts the session. “Are you hearing that?” Fincher asks the room. “It was like a truck passing.”
They listen. There doesn’t seem to be anything there.
“Maybe I’m having a stroke,” Fincher says, shrugging. “Let’s do one more.”
They try again, the words rising into the air over and over again, finally landing somewhere only David Fincher can hear them.
