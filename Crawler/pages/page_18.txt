The Alien franchise turns 40 this summer and what better way to celebrate this milestone than to revisit the black sheep of the acid-blooded Xenomorph family?

No, not Alien: Resurrection (1997), although that movie has its own host (see what I did there?) of issues. This time around, we'll be talking about Alien 3, the 1992 trilogy capper that should have one-upped James Cameron's Aliens (1986), just as that film managed to outdo Ridley Scott's original from 1979. Known for its several scrapped scripts and overwhelming studio intervention, Alien 3 also marked the directorial feature debut of an up-and-coming filmmaker by the name of David Fincher.


Ever heard of him?

At that time, Fincher was only known for directing music videos and no one could have guessed just how celebrated of an auteur he would become in the years to follow. However, the third Alien movie wasn't the best Hollywood resume builder, as the design-by-committee approach, the death of Hicks and Newt at the very start, and a sometimes unconvincing Xenomorph puppet composited into certain scenes (with some CGI sprinkled in) all culminated in a critical and box office flop, an occurrence the Alien IP had never seen before. Up until the early '90s, the franchise had, to quote the Nostromo's Ash, been "a perfect organism."


In the years since Alien 3's release and negative reception, fans have sort of warmed up to the project, not regarding it as a total mess. Even so, Fincher has disowned the movie and refuses to speak about it in any capacity. Three years later, his prestigious reputation would begin to take shape with the release of S7ven.
But what happened in that alternate reality where Alien 3 was not only a worth follow-up to Aliens, but a true realization of David Fincher's unique (and often dark) filmmaking style? What if he'd been given a free reign?

"Looking back, it was a very very very bumpy ride for everyone," Lucinda Syson, CSA, who worked as a casting assistant to Priscilla John on the film, told me during a phone interview. "I think David Fincher turned out to be an absolute genius and I think sometimes, there is this old fashioned thing about youthful first-timers or whatever not really knowing what they’re doing, but I think he was an inspired genius and was kind of overshadowed by some of the filmmaking protocol. That film could’ve been much of that sort of Edgar Allan Poe [style]. It was heading in that direction and I think that if David had been given his way [it would have turned out great]. I mean, he was exploring, too, at that point. Coming out the other side of that film, he went on to S7ven and blew everyone’s minds and so, I think if he’d been allowed a little bit more of his own reign in the first one, I think it would’ve been a different film."


Since that "baptism by fire" as she calls it, Syson has gone on to become an extremely accomplished and talented casting director, assembling actors and ensembles for major projects like X-Men: First Class, Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation, Wonder Woman, and the remake of Aladdin. She's also the casting director for Wonder Woman 1984, Terminator: Dark Fate, and the currently-untitled Game of Thrones prequel project about to start filming for HBO. Before you ask, I did try to get her to tease those things and she was, as you might guess, incredibly tight-lipped.
"Let’s just say they’re all brilliant and I’m thrilled to be part of them. I’m absolutely thrilled to be part of those projects. I feel very privileged," she said.20th Century Fox
Getting back to Alien 3, though, the plot revolves around Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) crash-landing on a prison planet inhabited by condemned criminals who get a shot at redemption when a Xenomorph gets loose on the compound. In addition to Weaver, the cast also includes Charles Dance, Charles S. Dutton, Pete Postlethwaite, and Lance Henriksen.
Things get even more complicated when Ripley learns that she is playing host to a Xenomorph Queen and ends up sacrificing herself before the organism can fall into the wrong hands.
"It was a very rocky road and incredible to be there for David Fincher’s first-ever feature," Syson added. "I think I learned an enormous amount on that film, because I was on the set. When I wasn’t in the casting office, I was helping on set with actors and things."
