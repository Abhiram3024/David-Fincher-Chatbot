Perhaps he means for the awards voters or for any studio executive who take him on  though right now few would dream of it.A year and a half since he agreed to turn the improbable story of a billionaire computer nerd into one of the most original pictures in years Fincher 48  a large authoritative man coolly commanding even in jeans and a black sweatshirt  has become a superstar flooded with offers for projects like his upcoming The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Its an odd twist for a director whos kept a skeptical distance from Hollywood most of his life and might have factored into his DGA loss.Alone on this rare day off except for an eager assistant who hurries to fetch us coffee he guides me through his studio past production rooms and sound booths and a tiny theater and into the art department where images abound from Dragon Tattoo the story of a bisexual hacker and the journalist she helps unravel a murder mystery.There are pictures of his heroines apartment the isolated house where some of the action takes place and a dungeon thats pivotal to the climax. Photos of various actors line the walls many in different shades of color which Fincher and his team used to explore ways to render the period when the photos would have been taken. Theres also an aerial view of the island at the heart of the story carefully charting each locales relationship to the others. Fincher has immersed himself in every detail of its geography just as he has Stieg Larssons bestseller on which the film is based. Hes a master of the meticulous  famous for his obsessive research and endless takes sometimes 50 or more per setup even so he shrugs At best you get 60 of what you want.Finally we reach his spare modern office centered on a wooden desk as imposing as Fincher himself. Warming up  as much as he ever allows himself  he takes out an iPad and clicks on a photo hes planning to use for the Dragonposter. It shows actor Daniel Craig halfhidden behind costar Rooney Mara whos looking directly into the camera. Her hair is spiky her face pierced with rings her body covered in tattoos. Its black and white and beautiful but theres no way in hell any studio will ever let Fincher use it as he knows.Because Mara is naked from the waist up.He is systematically antiauthoritarian says Bill Mechanic the former Fox chairman who greenlighted Finchers controversial 1999 drama Fight Club. He challenges authority challenges decisions. Fincher has been challenging them ever since growing up in Marin County Calif. ever since getting his big break making commercials at the ridiculous age of 21 ever since shooting his first film Alien 3 when he fought the studio so hard he got fired three times.Now he expresses just a modicum of regret. You dont want to see people cut off their noses to spite their face he says. But I probably did on my first movie because I foolishly thought being this squeaky wheel was the only way to be heard. Fincher fought bitterly to make Aliens 3his while the studio wanted it to be just another cog in its release schedule. The result was a work neither side liked.Fincher was 27 when he got the job and his career was flaring like a rocket but now it seemed poised to fizzle. The failure of Alien 3 made worse by inevitable comparisons to its Ridley Scott and James Cameron predecessors must have hurt more than he lets on. Critics panned it and the film made a disastrous 55.5 million domestically  quite a contrast to the success of Fincher videos such as Madonnas Express Yourselfand Aerosmiths Janies Got a Gun.He was very successful at a young age and had people try to take it away from him and he knows what that feels like his Social producer Scott Rudin says. But it still didnt make him toe the line. He has an anarchists mentality the producer adds. He likes to blow up systems.Even when those systems benefit Fincher himself. Time and again he refuses to do whats expected declining interviews even poking at the people who most support him. Ive been frustrated by what society wanted from me he acknowledges though hes hardly the confessional sort. I flip through catalogs and dont see anybody whos like me. Flip through a J.C. Penney catalog and you go None of these people hold any of my concerns. But arent they the very people who watch his movies He shrugs indifferent. The comfort zone he says is when they love and hate his work in equal measure. He recalls attending the premiere of Martin Scorseses 1982 release The King of Comedyand thinking This is fantastic  to take an audience to a place where they feel genuine discomfortWhere Finchers love of discomfort comes from is hard to gauge. The son of a Life magazine journalist and a mentalhealth nurse it was his father who introduced him to film. My dad loved movies he says. We used to drive into San Francisco and watch matinees. At age 7 he saw Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid.It was mindaltering. Theyre building fullscale trains and blowing them up. Theyre firing blanks at each other and riding on horseback and traveling to these locations  and theres Katharine Ross Who would want to do anything elseSix months later Finchers parents bought him a Super 8 camera and he started making his own films. It was liberating compared to his experiences at an alternative school where I was a disinterested student. I dont think I was trouble I just never bought into the idea that you are supposed to behave this way because somebody is wearing a badge. Life changed at 14 when Finchers family including his two sisters relocated to Ashland Ore. The teenager dreamed of returning to San Francisco and joining Industrial Light  Magic the company created by his former neighbor George Lucas.It was like Im getting further and further from the thing that I want to do he recalls thinking that if Lucas  whom he never knew well though they lived on the same street He was a very quiet guy  could make a career in the Bay Area so could he.After working as a local theater projectionist while at school  where he fell for films like Klute All the Presidents Menand Being There he volunteered at a TV station got a job with an animation company then at 19 joined ILM where he served as an assistant cameraman and matte photographer.His parents tolerated his refusal to go to college. But at ILM while he discovered how brilliant others could be he was also reminded that the establishment wasnt always right. I thought This is a bunch of guys in Wrangler jeans and plaid shirts who are scratching their asses and trying to figure this thing out  he notes. It was horrifying and liberating at the same time. I realized I had fallen for this idea because George Lucas has blessed these people with a place to blather around that they were somehow uberqualified. Really it was just a bunch of people trying to figure something out.NEXT PAGE FINCHER BREAKS INTO COMMERCIALS Three years later Fincher tried to figure out commercials. His first was one of his most memorable. A friend who was a truck driver and wanted to be a producer said Give me an idea for the American Cancer Society. So we sat down with some storyboard artists and said Lets do this thing thats the Star Child from 2001. Finchers ad showing a fetus smoking only made him 7000 but led to work on commercials and music videos first for Rick Springfield then after Fincher moved to Los Angeles for other artists.And yet Fincher was unhappy. I did videos that were progressively less and less expensive he complains. I ended up being signed by the musicvideo wing of a commercial production house and just didnt flourish and didnt have much fun. I got told by a lot of people that I was only good enough to play in the B or Cleagues I was never going to get the 1 million spots. His response I said F it lets start our own company. In 1986 with Steve Golin Sigurjon Sighvatsson and Dominic Sena Fincher founded the management advertising and production entity Propaganda Films making commercials and videos for the likes of Madonna Michael Jackson and Nine Inch Nails. Almost overnight their annual billings went from 2 million to 70 million. It was the beginning of the explosion of video directors becoming commercial directors Fincher recalls. It was also the beginning of commercial directors turning to features which crystallized for Fincher when he was given Alien 3.The directors runin with Fox was brutal. To this day he hates to talk about it. Asked whether he has disowned the film he says I never owned it and it has clearly soured him on studios  though he protests I like studios. I just dont like bureaucracies.They didnt like him either. Never the warm and fuzzy type one insider says Fincher was demanding. He is difficult with the marketing and distribution people especially one former colleague notes. But that comes out of not suffering fools.Asked about his manner  a certainty that can border on the cocky  Fincher hesitates. You know often times I think confidence can look like  it looks like different things to different people he says. But I dont think of myself as difficult. Were expected to do stuff thats awesome that means were going to have to push each other.Given this it might surprise Fincher that so many of his collaborators speak well of him. Producer Arnold Kopelson marvels at his knowledge of lenses of every setup. Hes an extraordinary filmmaker.Even Mechanic says Finchers reputation is exaggerated. There were lots of issues with the studio back and forth as always with David he notes of Fight Club. So I asked him to breakfast a few weeks before shooting and by the end of breakfast wed agreed on procedures and he stayed 100 true to his word. There wasnt anything at all contentious in the process. It was one of the best Ive ever had. By that time Fincher had redeemed himself with Seven1993 which in many ways defined his work dark visually audacious emotionally distant.I was the first person hired for the film Morgan Freeman recalls and I remember him talking to me about the process he wanted to use to make the film dark. I was intrigued. He controls where the camera is minutely where the actors are minutely where the lights are minutely. At the same time he is very collaborative.Fincher followed Seven with the Michael Douglas thriller The Game1997 then after Fight Club he moved on to the Jodie Foster starrer Panic Room2002 and Zodiac2007 an adaptation of Robert Graysmiths books about the Bay Area killer who was active when Fincher grew up.The film made only 33 million in North America but was one the bestreviewed pictures of the year. With it Fincher solidified his reputation as a supremely talented filmmaker if sometimes arrogant whose work was defined by its brilliance and also coldness.And so it came as a surprise to many Fincherfanatics yes theres a website of that very name when he took on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button2008 Eric Roths adaptation of F. Scott Fitzgeralds slender short story. What was a cool figure like Fincher doing on a warm love story like that I dont buy this notion that emotion and sentimentality are the same he argues. You wont see me on Barbara Walters Oprah thats not who I am. I dont like sentimentality because I dont like movies that tell me  I want to engage in a movie that says Here it is. Its not a colder point of view thats reductive. Its more adult.More adult than the films Fincher loved in his youth like Jawsand Star Wars I loved Luke Skywalker and I loved Darth Vader and I loved watching them work it out he reflects. But I also love Chinatown I love the fact that Jake Gittes Jack Nicholson is somebody that people had nothing but contempt for.Button earned 13 Academy Award nominations and raked in 127 million at the domestic box office. The film drew mixed reviews but reminded the industry that superstars like Brad Pitt  who also appeared in Seven and Fight Club  often delivered their best performance for Fincher. And yet its success was bittersweet not because the film won only three Oscars but because it left him utterly ineffably drained.It took six years to get that through the starting gate he sighs. It was just exhausting.NEXT PAGE FINCHERS SOCIAL NETWORKThe desire to avoid that exhaustion came into play with Social Network. Initially developed as a project for writer Aaron Sorkin to direct the screenplay was brought to Fincher by Rudin. I was given it on a Friday I read it on a Saturday and on Monday I was in a room with Sony Pictures cochairman Amy Pascal he recalls.After making sure Sorkin was willing to step aside I said I want to make the movie but I dont want to make it next spring. We have to be as close to ground zero with this phenomenon as we can. We have to be in Cambridge in the fall. Sony agreed. Following the usual back and forth  the studio wanted to make the film for 25 million Fincher insisted on 42 million  shooting began three months later. Unlike Zodiac where Fincher and Sony had parted ways over casting the studio accommodated the directors wishes.I said You gotta have 20 to 25yearold kids. You have to give me free rein to find the best people for these parts  he remembers. Now I said this on Zodiacand I got the list and its Russell Croweand Tom Cruise. This time Amy wanted me to meet people in the Sony fold. I said Lets cast it widely. They came back and said We get it. Go. Go meant allowing Fincher to shoot Sorkins 162page script uncut. After 68 days of filming in Boston and Los Angeles when Sony saw his rough edit  missing only the Henley regatta sequence that would later be filmed to fit Trent Reznors prewritten music  They didnt ask for any changes he says.The studios marketing executives were more resistant. We had the onesheet and we had to get that through Fincher notes. Key art designer Neil Kellerhouse came to us with one that had the tagline Punk prophet genius billionaire thief. It was fantastic but for about four months it was You cant do that Were not going to get involved in a lawsuit  Fincher smiles. I wanted Punk prophet genius billionaire Judas. Now hes back in the Sony saddle with Dragon Tattoo.Its two weeks after our first meeting and were in a tiny trailer at Paramount where Fincher is filming Dragonon six soundstages  even more than Button  and is huddled with his longtime companion and producer Cean Chaffin. An initial offer to visit the set has been scuttled at the last minute possibly because of Craigs reluctance to be spotted with Rachel Weisz though Fincher avoids the subject.Despite getting a huge budget and precisely the actors hes wanted Fincher seems frazzled dealing with an overheated studio where air conditioning has to pump in cold air to simulate the bitter Swedish winter  an ironic contrast to his Swedish shoot where the actors had to pretend the sun was baking while temperatures stooped to 40 degrees.Ive been shouting at everyone all morning Fincher grouses only halfjoking.Chaffin glances over concerned. Theyve worked together for 18 years and been a couple for 15 since Fincher split with his first wife following a brief marriage that left him with one daughter. Meeting Chaffin casts Fincher in a whole new light. Shes as warm and open as he can seem chilly and remote. Were oil and water he jokes. But in fact Chaffin reminds you of all the things its easy to overlook with Fincher His complete rejection of the Hollywood trappings his loyalty to those closest to him his strong bond with family his utter immersion in the work.Cean is very supportive of David Kopelson says. She makes it possible for him to be totally enmeshed in his life of making movies.Hell be enmeshed in Dragonquite a while longer. With a shoot that includes locations in Stockholm Zurich and England he still has 90 days of filming ahead. Its a giant project that Fincher initially avoided when his Buttonproducers Kathleen Kennedy and Frank Marshall broached it.I had just been through five years pushing a rock he explains. I sort of felt F I cant see anybody wanting to make a movie of this scale about a tattooed bisexual hacker in Stockholm. I cant go tapdancing again.He continued to resist even when Rudin obtained the rights. I was skeptical because the book is huge and there are so many characters he says. But what put it over the top was Sony chairman Michael Lynton and Amys insistence that they loved the idea of a franchise for adults. If you cant do a piece like this as a franchise theres no chance of ever doing one. Not that its been easy. First there was the issue of casting the lead Socials Mara. Then Fincher had trouble with his director of photography replacing him with Jeff Cronenweth. And finally came the reality of filming in Sweden. In the EU you cant shoot a 12hour day he explains.Between that the weather and the actors complicated schedules Fincher has had his hands full though hes thrilled with Mara. We got her an apartment in Stockholm and she kind of disappeared he says. She learned how to ride a motorcycle and got all of her piercings and tattoos. Also I asked her to learn how to skateboard because you need to stand like a 13yearold boy. I said I dont want you to stand like a girl. Insiders whove seen Steven Zaillians script say it focuses far more on her character Lisbeth Salander than the Swedish adaptation of the book. So Fincher desperately needs Mara to deliver  just as the studio needs him.There are degrees of wrong but ultimately Im responsible he says. Im either liberated or hamstrung by the material Im trying to make. But if Im hamstrung its my fing fault. He runs his hand through his hair thinking. Even with that rifle back in his studio should he ever need it there are limits to what he can do.Youre in charge but youre not in control the famously controlling director says. Anybody who thinks they are in control is nuts.

Michael Bay passed on the project saying the script needed work talk about funny and it was later reported that Fincher passed because it wasnt his thing. Ive always wondered how Finchers name got in the mix and what Finchers vision for SpiderMan would have been. Recently Fincher sat down to answer questions for The Guardian and the filmmaker was asked about the project.I was asked if I might be interested in the first SpiderMan... Im not interested in doing A Superhero. The thing I liked about SpiderMan was I liked the idea of a teenager the notion of this moment in time when youre so vulnerable yet completely invulnerable. But I wasnt interested in the genesis I just couldnt shoot somebody being bitten by a radioactive spider  just couldnt sleep knowing Id done that. ... I went in and told them what I might be interested in doing and they hated it.I also once heard that Finchers pitch involved the death of Gwen Stacy and at one point he relented to the idea of showing some of Spideys origin or maybe preorigin in flashbacks. Ive also read elsewhere rumors that Fincher wanted Edward Norton to play Peter Parker not sure if it is true or not.As much as I love David Finchers incredible films and as much as Im curious to see what he would have done Im kinda glad he never had the chance. I wasnt a big fan of the first SpiderMan movie but to me Sam Raimis SpiderMan 2 nailed the comic book. Im not sure the tone story and characters could have been presented any better.Recommended

David Finchers Rendezvous with Rama Officially Dead  FirstShowing.net HOMETRAILERS2024 SCHEDULE2025 SCHEDULESHORT FILMSREVIEWSPODCASTINTERVIEWSNEWS FEEDSABOUT USENJOY THE MOVIESDavid Finchers Rendezvous with Rama Officially Deadby Alex Billington October 13 2008I really dont think well ever see this adaptation get out of production hell. Our San Francisco correspondent Marco Cerritos caught up with David Fincher over the weekend at another Benjamin Button presentation. While his interview will be published in a few days we were anxious to find out any updates on his Rendezvous with Rama project. As a recap Rendezvous with Rama is a book written by scifi author Arthur C. Clarke that has been on the production slate for years. David Fincher was the most recent director attached which meant there was a potential that one of my very favorite directors would tackle a highly praised scifi epic. Unfortunately the project is officially dead in the water again.Fincher told Marco that It looks like its not going to happen. Theres no script and as you know Morgan Freemans not in the best of health right now. Weve been trying to do it but its probably not going to happen. Freeman has actually been the frontrunner on this adaptation from the start. He first took an interest back in 2000 and has been trying to get funding ever since. As everyone most likely knows he was hurt in a car crash back in August. In an update from Freeman last year he confessed that its a very intellectual science fiction film a very difficult book to translate cinematically. And while Fincher said he was attached he now confirms that a script never came together and that its officially dead.This is quite unfortunate news for those like me who were excited to see David Fincher finally explore the scifi genre again after Alien 3. The book surrounds a 30mile long hollow cylindrical alien spaceship that is found in our solar system and the crew that is sent to investigate this thing from outer space to find out what it is and what its intentions are. Sounds like an awesome concept and I wish it couldve made it to the big screen. But considering this has stuck in the development stage for over eight years Im not sure well ever see it make its way out of production hell. There are really only a few directors out there that I think could handle something like this anyway. If not Fincher then who elseFind more posts Movie News Opinions28 Comments1Im not sure this isnt a good thing for scifi films visually Im sure this could be quite stunning just  think MegaHalo but apart from a bunch of people wandering around an empty tube not a great deal happens in Rama.  It works very well as a book but as a film well... some things just dont translate....   but then .... Sunshine worked well...Dr.Duvel on Oct 13 20082I disagree. I grew up reading Rama and all directors I want to adapt it Fincher is easily at the top. No person can give the darkness and claustrophobia that I had always thought was there in the book. The story is very dark and unsettling and I think Fincher could do it. It made my day when I read the news how ever many months ago but this saddens me.Jordan on Oct 13 20083I think Doc Duvel is right. This probably would be like Finchers excellent Zodiac a fantastic film with a conclusion that feels somewhat empty. That film deserved all the accolades it got but it didnt exactly light the box office on fire. And it doesnt help that weak films like Independence Day have ripped off so much from Rama and stolen a lot of its thunder. Rama would be a fantastic event for film fans but not such a big deal for movie fans. It would probably be the Ang Lees Hulk of todays scifi films.kevjohn on Oct 13 20084How exactly did Independence Day rip off RamaID4 was just War of the Worlds with a computer virus instead of a biological virus as the key plot point. If anything they ripped off Wells since I dont recall ever seeing H.G. cited for inspiration during the movies opening credit.Tom on Oct 13 200851 YesThe first book left more questions than answers and it would be extremely difficult to faithfully translate it to the screen without boring viewers. Perhaps pulling ideas from all three novels would flesh out the storyline but the final destination and purpose of the 3 Ramas was so grand that it would also pose problems. Remember Contact anyonenef deppard on Oct 14 20086Well... Dr.Duvel might be right regarding the difficulty of taking such book to a movie... theres not much action involved... but if you think about it... there are actually 4 Rama books by Clarke  Gently Lee. Maybe he could start with the first one and then delve into the others.Marcel Lettier on Oct 31 20087I must agree with several of the comments already posted here that adapting Rama to the tastes and preferences of todays FX focued action oriented audiences would be daunting. The challenge is made more so by the sentiments of the books many fans that it remain true to Mr. Clarkes original text. Its also a great disappointment that Mr. Freemans recent health problems and the economy have contributed to the financial challenges.I still hope this project is undertaken since the book remains one of the best examples of Clarkes persistent theme of mankinds awakening to the nature of the universe. In the forty years I have been a fan of Clarkes work I continue to discover even more of its potential and its depth. The main problem in getting this project completed is to create a foundation for the script. I say foundation to mean a distilled set of themes that the professional script writer and the director can then make a workable storyline from. Since RWR has obvious thematic problems in rendering the movie storyline from just the first RWR book then we have to try to draw from Clarkes other works. The the others RWR books that followed were more commercial ventures instead of addition work by Clarke to finish the first RWR story. They add dimensions to the characters in the first RWR book but they failed to make Clarkes overriding theme of how mankinds perception of the Universe big u matures and is shaken by our First Contact encounter. Clarke tried in 2001 and A Childhoods End to suggest that our First Contact experience could revel to us a very different destiny for the human race than the one we expect.  In the end the themetic roadblocks this project now faces will remain unless a better development strategy is used. Im not suggesting I could design such a strategy alone but the book does have a large fan base and most of these fans are hard scifi geeks like myself who have solved much greater probems Im sure. What I am suggesting here is we follow an open source strategy for building the foundation of ideas I mentioned earlier. I am a firm believer in the idea that no problem is opaque if enough eyes are looking at it all bugs are shallow .... Clearly the RWR has enough fans to meet this criteria. Ill posts my initial thoughts here and later continue them in a blog which I am hoping others will contribute to. This idea of open source development of the scriptstoryline foundation has to have a structure and Ill be responsible for setting up a starting point. My first contribution is we dont expect that the official script writer and director will faithfully follow the material we create. I accept that as a possibility. We all must recognize that if a bunch of amatuer SciFi geeks help to write  a commercially successful FC movie storyline it will generate a great deal of buzz perhaps even more buzz than the picture itself. Another OSS Open Source Software idea Good programmers borrow great programmers steal and rewrite the lazy programmer principle. Id suggest the foundation of material draw from Clarks other works on the same First Contact theme like his novel A Childhoods End.  Even though this work takes the opposite approach to FC and man is prohibited from leaving the Earth  the stars are not for man it shares with RWR similar FC themes the mystery of not knowing what the alien race we first meet looks like or what their intentions really are. ACE and other Clark stories hold several themes like this which can help bring the mystery and suspense of RWR to a level where the professionals can see the project it is both commercially viable and has a foundation for motion picture production.    follows the same one as the books a three part movie series that bridges across this book and Clarkes other workPrince Riley on Nov 11 20088Ive just read the second book in the series and cant wait to read 3  4. I think Rama could work as a film but probably taking books 1  2 together to make the first and then if it was a success make a sequal from 3  4. Krubrick would have been the best man for this job but surely Ridley Scott would do a great job too It wouldnt need a lot of script like Alien its all about visuals and tension. The trip to New York in the second book would be amazing through Scotts Blade Runner eyes.Malcolm on Nov 11 20089Response to MalcolmI envy you Malcom. I first read RWR over 30 years ago and I still recall the experience with vivid detail. I picked it up at a trade book store in Chicago started reading it on the train ride home skipped my workout skipped dinner skipped going to bed and even took it to the bathroom with me. When I finished it about 4am the next morning I put it down and just sat there trying to take it all in.  The early morning quiet added more impact to the books ending ... they always do things in threes.What makes RWR so different from every other First Contact book I have read since remains the challenge Clark makes subtly at first and then a deafening roar at the end to the stock ending of other FC novels What if the grand destiny man thinks we will find out among the stars turns out to be that as a species we really dont matter What if we discover that the grand design of the cosmos is built around another race What if we are simply an interesting but ultimately unimportant margin note in Creations vast history book Yes I agree that a successful motion picture project of RWR would have to take themes from more than Clarks first book. However neither Krubrick or Ridely Scott whose work in the genre I do admire and respect are suitable to direct RWR. Also while I agree that RWR gives any FX production house a wide canvas to work on its bot enough. You need a script and characterizations to give voice to the storys many theme about FC. Otherwise the books many fans the motion pictures audiences especially critics  will very likely pan it as just another eye candy movie with very little human drama or interest. Yes Malcolm Alien and Blade Runner worked as films because they used the visuals and tension as a base for their appeal. Implicit in RWR this tension is invoked immediately when the object is first detected and thought to be a meteor. The discovery that Rama is this immense object that its not a natural phenomenon and is transiting our solar system with a definite purpose one that lies far beyond us is another source that has to be used to draw the audience into the films plot.  Also remember the tension created by Rama transit time table the investigation crew has to leave Rama well before they can make any extensive survey of the ship. As Ive said before Clarks second RWR book was not written by him as a sequel to answer the questions raised by RWR 1. If my research is correct the books original publisher Ballentine I believe and Clarks literary agent pushed him into the deal after the first books success became obvious. Clark resisted owing to his desire to write his autobiography but he eventually caved in to the pressure. However he wisely insisted that he only coauthor the second RWR book. That said the RWR 2 book is tainted and you should carefully consider how the much of Clarks original theme about Rama and its significance as a FC artifact remains undiluted in RWR 2. My own reading of RWR 2 is there is more focus on human civilizations reaction to the Rama engineers technical prowess. Yes the NYC trip could be a way of refocusing the audience on the human elements in the story but it isnt much more than a pit stop.     realizingPrince Riley on Nov 11 200810http RendezvouswithRama.blogspot.comIve started a blog at this web address to start the OSS script writing project for this bookPrince Riley on Nov 12 200811Maybe this needs to be adapted into a miniseries rather than a fulllength movie.  I was going to say scifi channel but then itd probably be horribly done... the special effects would be horrible.  Robert on Dec 10 200812I think youre right Robert. Maybe someone like the people who did 24 or similar and make it a series that really pulls you in. The SFX are always going to be the problem because this is a huge project. MalcolmMalcolm on Dec 10 200813I find it most disturbing that the film is not going to happen. Ill probably end up watching Star Trek 47 before someone is bright enough to produce such a great production as Rendezvous with Rama. Its a sad day in the SF realm when we not only lose Sir Arthur C. Clarke he passed away in Sri Lanka last year but we also lose a film adaption of one of the greatest Sf novels ever written. RWR would have been one the greatest SF films of all time...I have no doubt about it I would have savored every second of it. God Bless you Sir Arthur C. Clarke...I will miss you. Guess Im stuck with watching films like Vampire Lesbians from Gorema...sighJay CoxJay Cox on Jan 10 200914Mmmm.... mixed emotions about this. On one hand I was very excited about the prospect of a Clarke Klassic going to the big screen again would have prefered S.O.D.E but now that Clarke has alas taken the ultimate journey I am glad this project has stalled. No DirectoryScreen Writer could have mastered this story without consultation with its creator... it would be destined to fail as a simple parody of the original otherwise. I agree though that Ridley Scott would be best choice to Direct  one of the few Directors who could master the scope of this story.Brad on Jan 19 200915The major point I want to make is that there is a lot of junk out there but then theres this book. A classic by the master It is a major science fiction novel that screams out that someone needs to put in to film Why hesitate like this I dont understand especially when there is a serious draught in the science fiction realm. A major motion picture adaption of Clarkes masterpiece could and should revive a dying dry scifi market. Theres has been nothing but junk since the Hobbit hit theatres and then Director David Fincher has to put salt on an open wound. His latest film Mr. Buttons has been a dissapointment as far as I am concerned. If Mr. Fincher will deny us scifi fans such a great film as RWR then someone needs to bloody step up and take over such a great project  There is alot of great talent out there who would just jump at an opportunity to produce this.Jay cox on Jan 19 200916WE NEED MORE FANS OF RENDEZVOUS WITH RAMA ON FACEBOOKI NEED THAT MOVIEEEEEEEEEEEPLEEASEEEE FREEMAN GET BETTERezeqdb on Feb 1 200917How About Greg Bears EON insteasijones on Feb 9 200918Hi clarkefanI agree with your comments KSR has a brilliant mind The Mars books would be a massive undertaking and would require a dedicated fan base however he has written some pretty good shorter one off tales Antarctica for example.Another off beat idea Star Trek is being revisited No Leonard Nimmoy or William Shatner or any originals come to that how so about a fresh look at 2001 and the subsequent sequels.I am an avid fan of fifties SciFi how about someone paying homage to the genre by making any of the early ACC novels come to life on the big screen they were years ahead of thier time and all fairly doable as long as they werent too kitsch. What do you thinkijones on Feb 10 200919what a shameDanail Geshev on Mar 14 200920Looks like it is NOT dead after all. Fincher paid a visit to the AVATAR set and seems to be ramping up performance capture 3D tips for RWR.Jim Dorey on Apr 6 200921Ive just finished reading all four books. My last post was written after reading the first book. I have to say that reading all four changes the way I see the project but the bottom line is that if done properly this could be a massive success on a par with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. My main change of view is that the main narrative through the whole story is not Rama or the robots but is the incredible life experience of an amazing woman Nicole and the film should be told through her eyes and center aound her journey. Eveything else like the immense landscapes and wierd and wonderful robots should be the visual balance to her deep and moving story. I even think the first film It probaly needs three should start with her at training school or even with her escapdes with her mother in Africa and then once grounded should flashback to the first journey picking her up towards the end of the first film just before her flight to Rama 2 which will whete the appetite for the second film.If done right watching these films and living every moment of Nicoles journey should pull the audience right into the story and leave them breathless and thats without even mentioning all the mind blowing visualsMalcolm on Apr 7 200922MalcolmSo glad to read you finally drank all the RWR koolaide. Welcome to our passionTwo points first Making a movie on the scale that would be required is an undertaking that few studios let alone Mr. Freemans are willing to undertake without a great deal of the Hollywood Shuffle Aside from the script and casting issues which are very thorny ones there remains the technical and market issues investors and collaborators.As I am sure many of the readers of this blog have noticed during the opening credits of current films the list of partners seems to get longer and longer on each new film. Risk sharing and keeping the film world ecology health has required the industry to specialize with firms taking specific roles and sticking to them. What this means is the project has a few more hands to pass through before the collective wisdom and gut in Hollywood decides the film can be done profitable. We are about halfway through that process now by the looks of things. Yes the technical side appears to be forming up but we still dont have a script a casting profile and a director. More critical at this juncture  we dont have a producer.As to the producer  like many of us Mr. Freeman was struck by the books potential as a film and certainly he wanted to get this adaption done in the right way to satisfy the books huge fan base. No offense to Mr. Freemans production company or his other work but its very clear his production company is over matched and it has neither the experience nor the muscle to pull this kind of project off.  The surest sign that this is the case are the reported delays false starts and stalls reported here. Now LOTR went through a very similar process. But it did so at a time when the climate was much more welcoming and conducive. At this moment the industry isnt taking on any big bets with book material like RWR. In Hollywood biz this kind of thrashing back and forth are sure signs Mr. Freeman and others working on the project know that as well. What I am waiting for is for Mr. Freeman to bite the bullet admit his mistakes find a buyer for the books film rights and move on to film projects more suited for his companys scope and resources. Looking back at what happened with LOTR if RWR follows a similar path going from book to screen then we should all buckle up for a very long and bumpy ride. My recollection is it took almost five years for LOTR to make it to the screen from its official GO point. The director Jackson took up a tremendous challenge and worked the material into a series of films which was not considered a good move at the time. Also the films financing was to say the least unusual. I know that few of you are that familiar with the financing process for major films. If not then but just remember the age old adage follow the money.  At this point nothing is going to move ahead on RWR with any degree of certainty unless and until the money comes into this process. I know this might dampen everyones understandable excitement of RWR coming back to life its more realistic to expect not much will happen soon or quickly. What with the mess of the financial markets the slump in the economy and the other industry factors the production not the release of a RWR film is very likely at least three or four years away ...princeriley on Apr 7 200923This may be a bit naive but Jonathan Frakes would make a great director for this.  For most of his known career he has been involved with if not directing SciFi.  Being a part of the Star Trek saga he should know about the exploration of new thing.  The beauty of Rama is not that it is an exploration of an alien species but an alien species exploration of us.  I think he could pull this off.When it comes to actors for this film hell I know plenty of local actors in Huntsville including myself who would do a great job with this project.  The sad thing is the movie industry is so focused on hiring big names to act and direct that they overlook people who are actually good actors and directors.  If I were wrong Ben Affleck and Nicholas Cage would not have made more than one film a piece.Ellis on May 21 200924RWR is worthy of all accoldes it has received. Truly the Alice in Wounderland of science fiction novels. The idea of James Cameron doing the film adaptation is awesomexcelsiorx2000 on Jun 19 200925Ill try to write in english but im afraid that my redaction will not so clean for all of you dear fellows. Im a mexican fan of the master Clarke since a couple of dozen years ago and I ever believe that the first book is a truly masterpiece. I need to accept that Im not read the other three novels is very dificult find them in Mexico but I realize that thats not a reason enough but I think that the very first one is a brilliant story and enough to make a great movie. Im suprised I read intelligent and bright comments about the idea of make a movie about RWR either I think that the comments in this blog are made by very intelligent and sensitive minds which is explained by the kind of SF that writed Arthur C. Clarke and his readers. However I think that theres al least one possible movie director that is not considered but is mentionated Peter Jackson. PJ has shown what he can make with a very dificut book to translate in a very decent group of movies. His capabilities of make great scenes and situations are clear for me translate the complexity of LOTR the book in three very profitable and commercial films is there the care of the visuals and effects and the making of spectaculars scenes make me to believe that he could be another possibility to direct RWR. Of course Im totaly agree with the directors suggested above... but what do you think about my reflectionsAnd Im agree WE NEED RENDESVOUZ WITH RAMA TRANSLATE IN A GREAT MOVIESigfred Cid on Aug 23 200926Sigfred yes Id have to agree PJ would be another good candidate. He did a damn good job with those Tolkein books. I hope theyre all reading this heheh. I have to say Im not a huge fantasy fan I prefer hard science fiction but enjoyed LOTR all the same. I would so love to find you a Spanish translation of the other three books I hope you find a copy some day. I really think they have so much more depth than the first one. I see the first book as an introduction to the whole story but incredible even within itself. Youve got a lot to look forward toClarkeFan on Aug 23 200927I have to admit that I would not be disappointed if this movie never got made.   Very few books easily translate to good movies if they are followed faithfully and RWR is certainly not one of those.   How many classic SF books have been made into great movies  Even when the writers try to remain faithful to the plot line the result usually cannot compare to the visual story I have visualized when reading the book.  Most of the time the writers dont even try that hard to follow the original storyline because it is so difficult I never saw a Heinlein movie that resembled the books plot more than superficially.It is not fair to criticize the script writers if the book is very good and lights a fire under your imagination as RWR does how could a script writer compare to the intricate visual storyline the novel engenders in your mindRWR is primarily an introspective psychological drama with a lot of open questions and I am sure it  would need to be jazzed up with more action to be commercially viable.  The sequels which Clarke cowrote seem to bear this out in that for me they lack the lyrical pace and sense of wonder that the original had.If it is made I will go watch it of course.Alvin on Aug 30 200928First. as an old guy who has been reading SiFi stories since I was a youngster RWR was by far the most profound exciting and goosebump raising story I ever read...and reread and reread and reread... Unfortunately the three stories that followed did a great injustice to the original story and its profound potential as a prediction of how we might face the reality that we are not alone. The idea of god polluting the universe with nodes and prime monitors was less than entertaining and outright disappointing. I guess some might find a story where god decides a man in his 60s should marry a 14 year old novel. Not me.As for making it a movie done properly RWR could be a truly memorable experience but only if the movie stayed with the original story line.  Not only were the follow up stories crap but it would put too much story into one movie.  A classic example of trying to put too much story into one movie was Battlefield Earth which could only have done the story justice if it had been done as a trilogy.But if they can find the money I say go for it.fastflame on Aug 16 2010New comments are no longer allowed on this post.prevnextFEATURED POSTSVIEW MOREFOLLOW FS HEREOUR RSSSubscribe to our feed or daily newsletterFollow Alexs main account on Bluesky Follow alexb.bsky.social 			For only the latest updates  follow on X Follow FSnewsfeed Add our posts to your Feedly  click hereGet all our posts sent via Telegram Privacy ManagerLATEST TO WATCH					Thrilling Trailer for Larry Fessendens Indie Werewolf Horror Blackout Feb 19					Official Trailer for Shirley  Starring Regina King as Shirley Chisholm Feb 19					Action Thriller 5lbs of Pressure Trailer with Luke Evans  Rory Culkin Feb 19					Official Trailer for Doc Trilogy God Save Texas feat.

Follow him on Twitter DarrenFranich for opinions and recommendations.EWs editorial guidelinesPublished on October 3 2014Trending Videos01of 14   The Master Plan and the Master Planner  Theres a character type that runs through David Finchers work. Call it the Architect The personor group or sometimes even just an intangible forcethat sits at the center of the story often shrouded in mystery often playing an elaborate chess game with the lead characters as pawns. Kevin Spacey in Seven is one of the great chessmaster serial killers wrapping the detectives played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in his murderous tapestry. Many years later Spaceys headlining role as political mastermind Frank Underwood in the Finchercreated House of Cards is basically Mr. Doe Goes to WashingtonIn The Game Michael Douglas finds himself trapped in a paranoid world where everyone really is out to get him. The nightmare architecture of The Game gets repeated in the final act of Fight Club as Edward Nortons nameless narrator struggles against the omnipresent practically omniscient Project Mayhem. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoos ultimate nemesis is a more straightforward soliloquizingserialkiller archetype than John Doebut you could argue that the Architect of Dragon Tattoo is actually Lisbeth Salander who embarks on a very Tyler Durdenesque mission of mayhem computer hacking wiping bank accounts taking on The System in the films final act.You can understand why Fincher reacted to Gillian Flynns Gone Girl a book that shifts perspective between brutish husband Nick and missing wife Amy constructing a fearful symmetry of halftruths even before the storys major twists kick in. The mystery at the core of Gone Girl feels equivalent to the demonic antagonist of Finchers masterpiece Zodiac. The genius of Zodiac is how it constantly teases you with the presence of an Architect only to pull the rug outsometimes a scary man in a basement is just a scary man in a basement. Zodiac is sort of like The Game without the thirdact reveal The movies central horror is that there might not be a master plan after all.02of 14   Serial Killers  The Silence of the Lambs kickstarted the serial killer vogue but Seven defined the genre. John Does decision to base all his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins launched a million elevatorpitch murder plotlines. Murders based on Edgar Allen Poe Murders based on urban legends Fincher returned to the genre and in many ways deconstructed it with Zodiac. And The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo imagines a serial killer who likes to do his nasty business while listening to Enya. Why the obsession with mass murderersFincher likes to shroud his killers in mystery. Usually he literally shrouds them John Doe first appears in Seven as a shadowy outoffocus figure as subtle as a Dick Tracy villain. Hes a distant cousin of Raoul the home invader who lingers around the margins of Panic Room before his deeper madness is revealed. For Fincher there is something profoundly unknowable about serial killersand something magnificent which is why John Doe gets the last word in Seven.03of 14   Loneliness  Because Seven starred Brad Pitt at his youngpretty mid90s peak its easy to forget that the film really belongs to Morgan Freeman. Hes our initial viewpoint character and we see Pitts younghotshot cop through Freemans amusedmentor perspective. And whats striking about Freemans Somerset is just how lonely he is A man living in a quiet house he seems uncomfortable walking into the domestic sphere where Pitts Mills and his wife Tracy Gwyneth Paltrow are trying to make a home. Later in the movie we learn that Somerset was in love long ago then the girl got pregnant and Somerset askeddemanded that she get an abortion.This revelation comes in a casual diner scene where Tracy reveals to Somerset that she is considering having an abortion. Its not one of Sevens most famous scenes but its a remarkable standout in Finchers filmography Somersets whole central idea that it might be better not to have children is exemplary of a certain instinct towards loneliness that runs throughout Finchers work. Michael Douglas in The Game is a lonely rich man in a lonely rich house. Edward Norton in Fight Club is a lonely whitecollar businessman sleepwalking through his IKEA apartment. In Panic Room we meet Jodie Foster fresh from her divorceand her big new apartment feels epidemic of the confused emptiness at the end of a long relationship.In Finchers later work the drive toward loneliness becomes an explicit character trait. Jake Gyllenhaal in Zodiac lets his obsession with the case ruin his marriage Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network becomes impossibly successful only after he sheds his closest friends. Slightly more positive is the weird final act of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wherein Brad Pitts backwardsaging Benjamin spends the later decades of his life away from his family basically walking the earth like Caine in Kung Fu.04of 14   Digital Effects Invading the Real World  Every director uses digital effects today usually to create fantasy worlds or uncanny action scenes. But Fincher was one of the first directors to use digital effects as a way to explore and defamiliarize the recognizable real world. Fight Clubs camera moves through the trash in Edward Nortons deskand the only sex scene in the movie was filmed using the bullet time technique from The Matrix transforming the actors nude bodies into ethereal abstractions. Fincher pushed the innovations of Fight Club into nearparody in the overly excitable Panic Room where the camera swoops through household objects and doorframes.A couple years after Fincher made Panic Room his particular fascination with digitalreality reached a peak with the music video for Nine Inch Nails Only wherein normal objects on a normal desk start coming to CGIassisted life. And one way to understand the semiinexplicable Benjamin Button is to imagine the movie as a laboratory for Fincher experimenting with performancecapture effects to create Brad Pitts ancient toddler. Finchers digital addition has gotten less showy in his recent work but it hasnt gone away The director will often combine multiple takes into a single shot using digital composition which is what can make his films look eerily beautiful or sometimes just weirdly plastic.05of 14   Darkness and a Single Light  Part of what makes Fincher such a fun subject of study is that he doesnt have an obvious visualtrope toolkit No Abramsy lens flares no Wes Andersonian Xaxis no Spielbergian lookingintothesky. But Finchers films do have a vivid constant look Draped in darkness and shadow with a single color pervading or even dominating the frame. Panic Room is a showcase for this side of Fincher A film set almost entirely at night in a house with the lights off. The Social Network could be seen as an unlikely entry in Finchers worknobody diesbut part of the movies central frisson is how Fincher shoots everything like a thriller bathing nerdy Jesse Eisenberg in noirdark lights like hes the second coming of Harry Lime.06of 14   Obsession  When people talk about Fincher they usually talk about his style The antiseptic light falling on androidal skin the magazinead compositions. Its possible to accuse Fincher of being completely invested in style over substance An accusation that gains weight when you consider a movie like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a gorgeously composed adventure that never really goes anywhere.So what is Fincher all about exactly The most common consensus is Obsession. His Architect characters are obsessed with their own elaborate plotting. Fincher himself is a famously meticulous demiKubrick insisting on dozens or hundreds of takes. This is why Zodiac feels like Finchers most personal workthe central characters all become obsessed with the title character until their lives are consumed by their own obsession.07of 14   The Passage of Time  Or maybe The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isnt an outlier maybe its part of the key to understanding Finchers deeper themes. Benjamin Button hyperbolizes an F. Scott Fitzgerald short satire into a fantasy of a mans life As Benjamin gets younger we see him lose his parents take a lover have a child.Maybe what scares and fascinates Fincher the most is the simple passage of time. Two of his most wellknown commercials take a panoramic view of time The lives of two football players and the history of Earth basically. Time is the ultimate nemesis in Zodiac a movie that begins with the structure of a mysterythriller and then becomes scarier as it becomes chronological the years passing before the graying protagonists eyes. The shockcut of time is the central narrative structure of The Social Networkwe witness Zuckerbergs rise from the perspective of two rotating lawsuits and his best friend becoming a bitter enemy back and forth through time.08of 14   Modern Noir  Then again maybe its simpler to look at Fincher as our preeminent practitioner of noiralbeit uniquely modern noir where half of the mystery is figuring out what kind of mystery is being solved. Fight Club gets remembered today for the big Tshirtworthy speeches but the film is also a meticulously crafted mystery. Coming out in theaters just a couple months after The Sixth Sense Fight Club has a finalact twist thats every bit as wildand if anything the twist in Finchers film is more convincing insofar as there are clues spread throughout almost every scene. And in Gone Girl the central mystery is constructed on a 3D chessboard where its hard to even say what crime has been committed much less who committed it.09of 14   Brad Pitt  Finchers most consistent onscreen collaborator Pitt received one of his first truly great star showcases in Seven. The way Fincher uses Pitt in the movie is telling At a time when most filmmakers were playing off the actors goldengod good looks Fincher beats him to a pulp midway through. And thats just a prelude for the final devastating gut punch. Fincher doubled down on that abuse in Fight Club transforming Pitt into a new kind of masochist superman.Pitts presence is part of the central weirdness of Fight Club. When Tyler Durden points at a Calvin Klein ad for a skimpy manthong and asks Is that what a man looks like its hard to forget that Pitt basically was that guy in his original showcase Thelma  Louisenot to mention the fact that Finchers camera lingers obsessively on Pitts ridiculously cut body. Theres something equally weird at work in Benjamin Buttononly Fincher would cast Brad Pitt in a movie and make him look like a cartoonbaby Donald Rumsfeld for the first half hour. By far their most lighthearted collaboration was a Heineken commercial that ran during the 2005 Super Bowl.10of 14   Trent Reznor  Finchers relationship with the Nine Inch Nails frontman began with the opening credits sequence of Seven although their first proper collaboration was the music video for Only. That was just prelude Reznor and Atticus Ross have become Finchers goto soundtrackers composing the Oscarwinning score for The Social Network and providing the moody tones for Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl.11of 14   OldWorld Glamour  Because Finchers filmography is so tied into a certain scuzzychic sensibilitysteam flowing out of pipes the bleak dystopiGotham of Sevenits worth remembering that Fincher may have a retro even romantic heart. His video for Madonnas Vogue all the dreamy dancing scenes in Benjamin Button the jazzgloss of Suit and Tie It all speaks to an uppercrust sensibility the kind of stuff that Tyler Durden would want to explode.12of 14   Science Fiction For the Modern Age  Fincher has come close to making big action movies. At one point he was onboard to helm Mission Impossible 3 hes also been circling an adaptation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and certainly its easy to see how an obsessive Architecttype like Captain Nemo would fit into Finchers filmography.Yet Fincher is rather unique among modern bigname directors in that he hasnt ever made a straightup scifi flick. Theres one exception Alien 3 a film that Fincher has essentially disowned and which is mostly interesting for anyone who wants to see a master director in his infancy achieving mildly interesting things along the margins of mediocrity.But Alien 3 does feel in step with much of Finchers workand I think its because so much of Finchers work takes a fantastical genreinflected look at the real world. Many of the early scenes of Fight Club suggest a real world invaded by outside forcesEdward Nortons apartment isnt just an apartment its an advertisement for IKEA. Zodiac prequelizes that sensibility presenting the early 70s as a time when the rise of mass media conjured up a strange new power. A prank caller could be a terrorist a single killer could hold a city hostage. And The Social Network locks into the central fascination of the Internet age How a simple idea can become a societyaltering experience and in the process rapidly age excitable young college kids into emotionless bigbusiness tycoons. Theres an angle on The Social Network where it almost feels like Peanuts chronicling a group of children squabbling while adult authority figures bleat helplessly in the background.13of 14   Men Who Destroy Themselves  Or maybe its simpler to approach Fincher as the chic nihilist that so many of his films proclaim him to be. Suicide runs throughout his work. John Does final act attempts to transform the murderer into his own victim. Fight Clubs loopy premise turns the lead characters internal struggle into an external battle with his own darkest self. The Game can be seen as an elaborate act of suicide preventionalthough that only becomes clear that Michael Douglas tries to commit suicide.His fall off a building resembles Ripleys fall in Alien 3 although her action is more complicated and more openly heroic. Because if Fincher likes men who fight themselves he also likes...14of 14   Women Who Fight Back  Fincher doesnt like Alien 3 but it makes sense that his first big break came in the Alien franchise. Sigourney Weavers Ripley is one of the great action heroines fighting back against the xenomorphic menace. Alien 3 takes the rape allegory at the center of all the movies and specifically applies it to Ripley as she carries an alien baby she doesnt want the whole movie is structured in a sense as her vengeance on the manthing that wronged her.Female vengeance is the centerpiece of Panic Room wherein a jilted housewife fights back against the men invading her house. Its the central underlying factor of the showcase scene of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a movie that explicitly casts Rooney Mara as a vengeful superhero for wronged women everywhere. And Gone Girl might be the high point in Finchers feministic filmographyall the more because of how the film complicates our perspective on the title character.Related ArticlesMichael Fassbender slays in teaser for David Finchers The KillerWhy Sevenstill has one of the most shocking endings in cinematic historyEvery David Fincher movie ranked by EW gradeThe 12 best Brad Pitt moviesDavid Fincher How the years real best director became a bornagain filmmakerThe Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonHow David Fincher made ZodiacFrom the EW archives The blood sweat and fears of Fight ClubGone GirlTrent Reznor on the Gone Girl music working with David Fincher and translating David LynchHoliday preview The Girl With the Dragon TattooPopWatch Confessional The thing you hate that everyone else loves25 Greatest Active Film DirectorsBrad Pitt The EW interviewAre Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass the top actordirector pairingFall Movie Preview DecemberEntertainment WeeklyNewsletterFollow Us            TVMoviesMusicWhat To WatchBingeCelebrityThe AwardistBooksTheaterAbout UsTerms of ServiceSubscribeAdvertiseDiversity  Inclusion PledgeCareersPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesEntertainment Weekly is part of the Dotdash Meredith publishingfamily.Please review our updated Terms of Service.Newsletter Sign UpNewsletter Sign UpBy clicking Accept All Cookies you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation analyze site usage and assist in our marketing efforts.

Merrick Morton  NetflixDavid Fincher Is Still Fascinated By Serial KillersThe director of Seven returns to familiar material with his new Netflix series Mindhunter.Adam Grant											Oct 13 2017					The first rule of interviewing David Fincher Dont talk about Fight Club. He directed that movie along with Seven Gone Girl Zodiac The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and The Social Network. Hes also an executive producer of House of Cards. One of the most meticulous creators in film and television returns to familiar territory on October 13 with Mindhunter a Netflix drama about how the FBI first developed techniques to catch serial killers and rapists.Adam Grant Whats the best piece of career advice youve ever received David Fincher Joel Schumacher who I consider to be one of the wisest people Ive ever met once told me a great thing You have to be very careful not to become the only person who cares because then they have you. You have to be prepared at any moment to say You guys seem like you have it all under control and you have a very clear idea about what it is that you want. Why dont you just do that Why do you need me to be involved The only way youre ever going to be in control of what it is that youre doing is to be prepared to not be involved.I look at directors who say Well I just have to do something. I havent done a movie in two years. Im like Really You have to do something I feel like you shouldnt do somethingyou should do the thing. You should be ready to go to the mat for it. You should be ready to say This is the way that this should be done. So dont care too much. Thats an unfair paraphrasing but what Joel meant was you have to somehow impart how much you care about stuff to a number of other people and get them to care. You cant think of it in terms of what youre going to get out of it. You have to think of it in terms of planned obsolescence. Ill never be finished with it at some point itll be finished with me.I feel like you shouldnt do somethingyou should do the thing.Youre rumored to be perfectionistic in reshooting scenes. Is that true How do you know when creative work is done Thats a lot of bullshit. Among the lazy I would be considered a perfectionist. I have scenes in many of the movies or television that Ive made where its simply you missed it you didnt get it and you have to kind of then rethink it and go Where does the best material take us I just dont believe in cutting a sequence based on Well this guy wasnt having a good day so were going to play off him onto somebody else. Thats unfair to the actor and unfair to the audience. I feel like its my job to let the structure of the images be decided by what the story needs as opposed to what the performances will allow. Were playing dressupits not like youre asking someone to go through openheart surgery again.I think that cinema is hopefully a kind of creative Darwinism and the best ideas prevail. Part of my job as director is to put blinders on people and youre trying to put blinders on yourself so that you dont get bogged down in minutiae that no one will ever experience or will ever accrue to a greater value of understanding or appreciation of the final product. But you also have to leave yourself open enough that when something happens that should be a part of your story you dont steamroll it looking at the schedule or looking at the sun.NetflixYou seem to be drawn to these people who live very dark lives or have very dark things that go on in their minds. Seven is sort of gloriously absurd in the canon of the criminal masterminds. Its interesting to me I dont know if its interesting to anyone else. There was always a house in any neighborhood that I ever lived in that all the kids on the street wondered What are those people up to We sort of attach the sinister to the mundane in order to make things interesting. I think that theres a tendency for the human mind to work that way. I think its also because in order for something to be evil it almost has to cloak itself as something else.What are you hoping to do to your audiences Is the goal to make people terrified that everyone they meet might be a serial killerListen should we help people look for their lost animals Probably. Should third graders help strangers look for lost animals Not in this day and age. I would hope that as human beings we would make ourselves available to helping people who are in need. But the reason these predators continue to fascinate us is that we want to write this behavior off as madness. Yet to be a serial killer you have to kill at least three peoplewhich means you have to not get caught with the first two. For that to happen you have to be fairly thoughtful in premeditation. Its the hiding in plain sight. Thats the thing that I find terrifying about them.What have you learned about the minds of profilersThe Silence of the Lambs was an incredible recruiting tool for the FBI. They were asking me Is Mindhunter going to be like Silence of the Lambs No. Investigators are criminal masterminds in a certain way but very sad. When you engage with this kind of inhumanity it comes at a cost. We gift them with these superpowers but really they are just very thoughtful hunters. They have to imagine every permutation. What if the killer does this What if the victim does this They have to work this stuff out in advance. Its not Anthony Hopkins its not a gourmet chef sommelier and chess master. These killers are abused confused and evil people. This show is much more about following the trail of inhumanity.Investigators are criminal masterminds in a certain way but very sad. When you engage with this kind of inhumanity it comes at a cost.If you could go into any writers room and be a fly on the wall where would you goId probably go to The Sopranos Season Five or Six. I would like to watch David Chase work. It seems like a very complete world in somebodys head. And then maybe Deadwood Season One. At one point I was two millimeters from saying yes to directing the pilot and part of it was I was just so fascinated with David Milch. Milch and Chase are masterful. They both have a great ear as to how things can be presented or how you can get things out of characters. I think thats an odd gift and it intrigues me.NetflixYoure working on your fourth film with Brad Pitt. Whats the secret of that connectionThe gift of that relationship that keeps on giving is that we have a very similar appreciation of the great cosmic joke. Its like we dont even need words. Youve reached a point where you just like gibberish and you can kind of communicate in guttural utterances.A film is a standalone creative product a show is an ongoing story. How would you contrast directing in those two worldsIn movies theres almost no room for characterization anymore and in television theres no money for plot. The monetary constraints in television tend to make most of your entertainment value about characterization. The antithesis is true in movies because no ones interested in anyones backstory or how conflicted they are but in what theyre doing or whether or not something resonates with them. Youre there to thwart the destruction of the world. On a movie set youre the general people work for the director. In television you work for the show and you may not ever meet this director again. Theres a tendency to see the director as a migrant worker. These arent longterm relationships. The urgency is differenttheres no navelgazing.In TV with so little time for management by walking around let alone actually getting to know people how do you build relationships with your teamI pride myself on being half an hour early and leaving half an hour after everyone else and I make myself available to answer any questions.

Austin Collins								K. Austin Collins						Creed III Is a Muscular Punishing Statement on Race in America	A Terrifying Tale of a Teenage Girl Groomed Into Being Sex Trafficked	Cocaine Bear Has More Coke and Gore Than a Night With Charlie Sheen	View all posts by K. Austin Collins	November 12 2020	NetflixThe first surprise  was that David Fincher Hollywoods masterinfluencer of stylish impeccablydesigned thrillers was making a movie about the writing of a screenplay. A jarring matchup  even if the screenplay in question is Citizen Kane and even if the debate over Kanes authorship in which Orson Welles contribution became subject to questionis storied and vibrant enough its relationship to Hollywood history robust enough to merit a movie. The pairing of director and subject seemed curious a maybepromising prospect with a potential dash of latent misfire.The movie itself Mank  which will receive a limited theatrical release on Friday followed by a Netflix streaming release on December 4th  is the second greater surprise in large part because of its successes. Mank is Finchers eleventh feature the first since Gone Girls rigorous blackly comic bloodletting in 2014. Though the horizons of Finchers art have always been broader than they at first appear  this isnt even the intensively modern directors first period picture  Mank is somewhat unnerving in its sincerity and topical breadth its tense mingling of history and speculation its ironically pointed attitude toward the Hollywood studio system. This last point only gains more traction and intrigue in light of this movie being from the outset a production of Netflix International Pictures a fact somehow inseparable from the films congealed rash of ideas. Commerce art period politics Its all here. Among Fincher diehards the result will probably bemuse some bore many and thrill a relative but hearty minority. Count me in the minority. Mank stars an exceptionally loose and selftorturous Gary Oldman as the soggy bedridden hero of the title a man who as of the movies 1940 frame narrative has a major screenplay to finish writing and a barrel of demons to contend with in the meantime. The story goes that the wunderkind Welles only 25 or so years old has just been given carte blanche by RKO Pictures to make his first movie  any movie about anything with anyone he wants. So he chooses the washedup alcoholic gamblingaddicted Herman J. Mankiewicz the journalist critic and playwrightturnedstudio man whose Hollywood ties have by this time withered. A man who on Welles command can only be trusted to pull off this feat if hes been hidden away at the North Verde Ranch in Victorville California to complete the mammoth first draft.			Editors picks											The 250 Greatest Guitarists of All Time												The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time												The 50 Worst Decisions in Movie History												Every Awful Thing Trump Has Promised to Do in a Second Term			Mank has been assigned a trio of overseers caretaker Fraulein Freda Monika Grossman typist Rita Alexander Lily Collins and actorproducer John Houseman Sam Troughton whose main job is to keep Mank dry. This is a tough enough task that Houseman sets Mank up with a cache of sedatives in alcohol bottles. Mank is on deadline First hes given 90 days then 60 to pop this out. But as Finchers film allows it to play out the time nearly evaporates. Its not so long before seemingly all of a sudden the embattled Mank has only two weeks left to make sense of a draft thats as brilliant as it is overlong unconventional and  given who everyone rightly presumes it to be about  dangerous.That last part the danger is what gives Mank some only some of the tingly chaos youd expect of a Fincher movie. The threat isnt exactly comparable to the Zodiac killer its definitely no Amazing Amy who is. But whats clear from the outset is that theres a great risk being taken in the writing of Welles movie. There isnt a soul in the room who doesnt know that Kane is a standin for media titan William Randolph Hearst. A few people  including Manks brother the soontobelegendary writerproducer Joseph L. Mankiewicz Tom Pelphrey  even try to lure Herman ashore with safer projects easier money. One of Manks key swerves is in fact its willingness to give credence to the danger of that operation. And it splits itself nearly in two to do so with the Victorville frame narrative serving as but a backbone for a conflictridden vibrant tour of the years leading up to it. The real meat of Mank isnt in the writing of Citizen Kane in other words but in its detailing of the ideas and experiences the intellectual wrestling and brewing antagonisms that Mank will metastasize in his behemoth script. Its not so unusual for a film hovering anywhere near the biopic genre to make legible connections between the ideals of its hero and the experiences that shaped those ideals. But in Mank the extensive flashbacks to the 1930s are so dominant that they nearly serve as an alternate present tense. Here Hermans studio past  his ties to the likes of actress Marion Davies Amanda Seyfried studio giant Louis B. Mayer Arliss Howard and Hearst himself Charles Dance  are rife with a sense of contingency at times even despair. The past in this movie surpasses its function as mere explanation for its heros present. Hollywood of the 1930s emerges instead as the pulpy stirring heart of this story.			Related											Einstein and the Bomb Hits What Oppenheimer Left Out												Girls5Eva Reuniting for Third Season... This Time on Netflix			And the story this movie tells is a tough and disconcertingly relevant one. We watch as the beleaguered Mank a wry and magnetic wit unassumingly talks himself into the steady company of Davies thus quickly becoming a regular guest of Hearst  Davies partner  at a time when the media magnate has made serious headway into the talkingpicture business. We and Mank soon learn what propels Hearsts interest. In a word power. And peering over Manks shoulder through it all we come to see Mayer as the Sancho to Hearsts Quixote. Through lively and extensive dinner scenes and walkandtalks and vigorous arguments Mank encourages us to witness the ways that Hearst has begun to wield Hollywood as the political vehicle that in Manks gimleteyed view it practically begged to become  a way of intervening on socialist politics represented here by the political campaign of Upton Sinclair. Hearst has already played a direct hand in national politics by way of the Roosevelt White House. Thus his influence and reach grow terrifying  if quietly so. News from overseas portends great trouble from Germany war a crippled economy and the increased susceptibility of the public to the power of images hobble and shape citizens overall impression of the state of the world. And Mank court jester though he may seem when hanging out at Hearsts San Simeon palace seems to see all of it coming. That friends is the magic of the movies. As Mank puts it more than once our willingness to suspend our belief at the door  to believe in King Kong towering the heights of the Empire State Building when those silverscreen images are flickering above our heads or from our TV screens  is what keeps Hollywood in business and simultaneously risks making sitting ducks of us all. One of the surprising subjects of Mank is thus its insistence on the role of movies in shaping public understanding an idea that matters very much to the Mank Fincher has dreamed up in this movie. Its a wellknown story as essential to the myth of Herman Mankiewicz as it is to the Hollywood studio system of the 1930s that Mank who was at one point a recruiter of writers into this thankless machine sent then upandcomer now legend Ben Hecht a telegram that read Millions are to be grabbed out here and your only competition is idiots. And then Dont let this get around. The Hollywood of Finchers Mank is in fact not quite a haven of idiots one triumph of the movie however is that you see how Mank got there. You also grow to understand that Manks Hollywood was a repository of dangerously entangled rich shameless people. Effective people. Powerful people.Mank doesnt tell us why Welles chooses Mank of all men to script his Hollywood debut. The movie is in fact tellingly scant on impressions of Welles  though when he appears as played by Tom Burke the movie makes it count. But theres an idea that unites these men the idea of Hollywoods allure its power to lure men like Mank Welles and countless others into the dream factory where what awaits are not big chances at challenging ideas and personal art but rather a monied politicized wellrun machine. Its in the context of all of this that the filmmaking goodies here  the use of oldschool mono sound the widescreen blackandwhite images expressionistic smoky silhouettes Big Acting Thirtiesappropriate wit in the writing  feel not only playful but gilded knowing and pleasurably awry. Fincher hasnt quite made a genuine imitation of a 1930s picture. Fincher can hop genres but he can never abandon his masterfully clinical visual stamps which include all of the playful imitationfilm cigarette burns and graininess mussing the hair of the movies glossy digital images. He has instead used that acute visual cynicism of his to deliver something too sticky and uncomfortable to be straightforward nostalgia. Thats a credit to his intentions here frankly given that hes of the nostalgic movieobsessive New Hollywoodweaned auteur generation. But the movie is fun and its nostalgia is pleasurable if you allow it to be. Its something of an uphill battle at first. The opening 30 or so minutes risk confusion and disorientation in scenes that dont always hit the mark. Then Mank meets Davies as if by chance as shes slowburning at the stake between takes on a movie set. Seyfried isnt an exact match for Davies but she has great fun with Brooklynborn actress slick accent and personality. Davies emphatic presence here is poignant to begin with the character in Citizen Kane presumed to be based on her who was moneyhungry and talentless ruined her reallife reputation  painful proof of Manks concern about silver screen fictions overtaking reality. Seyfried gives Davies a soul Mank gives Seyfried just enough room to do so. Likewise Hearst Mayer the brother Mankiewicz and a gaggle of namechecked studio legends are all given real energy and life in performances that are to a person tantalizing and memorable. Theres blood in the veins of these people who just as easily could have become talky platforms for the movies ideas. Certainly theyre all representative of whats at stake here. But theyre fun to watch.Which is a good thing for a movie that seems destined to generate  has in fact already generated  some suspicion. Again theres the problem of history. The debate over who actually wrote Citizen Kane dates back to at least Pauline Kaels 1971 missive originally published in the New Yorker casting doubts as to Welles being the dominant author. It was heartily debunked. But a movie that pushes Manks efforts to the forefront and restricts Welles to a few pointed scenes with a nod toward the revisions that the director would later make that doesnt specify the extent of those revisions might appear tobe flirting with the murkier side of that debate.Even this as the movie explores it isnt so simple if anything the movies closing moments which jump forward to the culminating Academy Award shared by both men for the script wink at this very question. All of which is to say nothing of the fact that the Orson Welles of this movie bears a humorously cutting physical resemblance not only to the real Welles but to one David Fincher. And yet the script for Mank which was originally written by Jack Fincher the directors father makes it easier in so many ways to imagine that Fincher sees himself as more of a Mank. Heroically flawed sure but heroic with his back against the wall and the studio system serving as the firing squad. If its the movies intention to undermine Welles role in the writing of his most timeless movie  a movie which it cant be forgotten laid the thematic groundwork for Finchers own Social Network  it doesnt quite succeed in that intention. Im not convinced that it is one. What Mank does more purposefully and with greater vigor is redirect our attention to the problem of movies writ large and what they do and how they can be used. Its the way that Fincher gets at this problem through knowing but plausible historical fiction movienerd fanfic that ultimately wins me over. And so does the irony of it all. Mank is what Fincher decided to make finally after his fathers script had languished in a drawer somewhere for years when Netflix asked if he had any dream projects up his sleeve. In its production and conception the film is intensely personal. For many this  and the usual Fincher promises of estimable and enormously controlled production surprising acting and perfect images  may be the most interesting indeed the only interesting thing about it. But the rest of us are in for a wild ride and an unexpected treat.

The canonical texts written on the subject notably Raymond Borde and tienne Chaumetons Towards a Definition of Film Noir 1955 and Paul Schraders Notes on Film Noir 1972 read like how to guides for understanding films like Alien 3 Seven Fight Club and to a lesser extent The Game and Panic Room. Schrader points out that film noirs techniques emphasize loss nostalgia lack of clear priorities insecurity then submerge these self doubts in mannerism and style. In such a world style becomes paramount it is all that separates one from meaninglessness. 1 If this is true Fincher has created a series of films that are anything but meaningless. His slick and glossy treatment of a dark world frequently garners accusations that his films are shallow experiments in style. It is more accurate to say that Fincher absorbs the fleeting styles and tastes of Hollywood reflects them and twists them. He pulls back the curtain revealing a mechanical process at the core of the filmmakers art leaving us to wonder how we lost our humanity in something we love so much.Perhaps the most disturbing thing about Fincher is his proven ability to buy artistry at 7000 a second. The idea that a film can cost 50 millionplus inspires nausea in most critics and it is tempting to bury our heads in the sand and pretend that all that cash doesnt really make a film any better. But while many directors with fat studio wallets are falling over themselves to get the biggest bang for their bucks Fincher is lacing his films with effects that are subdued moody and often transparent. He is mapping out impossible camera movements with CGI commissioning intricate sets that would make Dario Argento drool tweaking every last detail in postproduction and reshooting copious amounts of footage after the principal photography has wrapped. He appears to have the studios figured out and is able to make films the way he wants with or without the final cut.Fincher cultivated a healthy respect for bigbudget filmmaking as a teenager when he landed a dream job at Industrial Light and Magic. He worked on special effects cinematography for films like Return of the Jedi 1983 and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 1984. As if this experience didnt already place him at the chewy centre of his generations pop culture he then went on to direct music videos for among others Madonna Michael Jackson and the Rolling Stones. Fincher also found a place directing lavish commercials for corporations like Nike Levis Pepsi and CocaCola this profession has since sheltered Fincher from the whims of the studios giving him time to choose his projects and negotiate a decent amount of control over them. It has also provided those who disapprove of Finchers films with a convenient justification. There are dissenters who simply object to all films of quality and Finchers work with commercials and music videos leads him to produce films with extremely precise lighting editing and dcor.Fincher proudly stands behind all of his work except Alien 3 and defends himself against his detractors. He says theres this assumption that commercials are just closeups of celebrities holding products up to their faces. But some of them are great art. Its not the art of the surrealistic painting or the poem but it is art. 2 Finchers definition is refreshingly inclusive. At the same time Fincher hints that the relative importance of a film is fleeting and indeterminateI think the movies I make are trifles. Theyre footnote movies. Im not making big important movies Im not making Bridge on the River Kwai. Im not dealing with big noble themes. But again I couldnt imagine somebody wanting to remake Psycho so maybe Im wrong. 3Maybe thats why he continues to make thrillers even though he believes that comedies are probably more important to the human psyche than movies that scare people. 4 Or maybe he aspires to exorcise our demons by showing them in their entirety. The unique combination of despair cynicism and the occasional burst of calculated sadism that pervade Finchers films has surfaced only on rare occasions in Hollywood cinema during the past 50 years and each time it leaves a scar.Finchers first feature film Alien 3 1992 was a critical and commercial failure. Wrought with agony under the iron fist of Twentieth Century Fox Finchers vision for the sequel was demolished by the studio. Fox was plainly unwilling to gamble on an even darker version of an already depressing film especially when handing over an unprecedented budget to a firsttime director. By the time the ordeal was over Fincher reportedly swore he would rather have colon cancer than direct another picture. 5 Finchers later film career may not have been so successful nor his fan base so large if Alien 3 had been a benign success. After all there is no better way to gain sympathy as a director than to have your dreams crushed by heartless studio executives. However greatness or even the possibility of greatness does not typically descend from sympathy. Alien 3 taught Fincher a valuable lesson. Keep your friends close but keep your enemies closer. New Line Cinema and Fox Studios executives put their careers on the line to give Fincher extra time and money to tinker with the endings of Seven and Fight Club.Alien 3 replays much of the content of Ridley Scotts original Alien 1979. The outgunned and unprepared humans unable to flee because they are adrift in space overcome the odds and destroy the creature that is hunting them. However the originality of Alienthe shock of a living man giving birth to the creature as it bursts from his chest the betrayal of the crew by its android companion and the strength of the female protagonist that ultimately casts the creature into spaceis intentionally absent. Imagine a stock horror film where the defenseless teenagers simply surrender to the serial killer at the outset. They do eventually destroy the creature but only because they have nothing better to do.The visual language of the film was carefully planned to nourish the paranoia and isolation of the films plot. The camera is always looking up at the smooth lines of the neogothic interiors but the angle only makes the film more claustrophobic because the camera never gets far enough away to make us feel comfortable with the surroundings. Even if we werent always so close to everything its unlikely it would make any difference. As the films cinematographer Alex Thompson pointed out Fincher was always saying Keep it dark keep it dark making it very difficult for him to maintain any sort of color in the image. 6 The end result is a gritty chiaroscuro sepia that doesnt let up.In the last few minutes of the film a curious attempt is made to resurrect an SF atmosphere. Men in white suits  la E.T. arrive after the destruction of the alien to take Ripley and her child away. They want to develop the alien life form into a weapon. Robin Woods comments on the end of Alfred Hitchcocks Shadow of a Doubt 1943 seem particularly relevant here when he says that the Hollywood ideology is shattered beyond convincing recuperation. 7 This sudden influx of guns and enemy soldiers is too little too late. As Ripley jumps to her death clutching the newborn alien to her chest Alien 3 is unable to find resolution in this or any other context. Since that moment fans have prayed nightly that a directors cut of Finchers original concept will be released. Fincher however would just as soon see the films original negatives destroyed.Fincher proved his aptitude for moody set pieces with his next film Seven 1995 a drama about two detectives who track a heavenbent serial killer who chooses his victims and their deaths according to the seven deadly sins. The film is viscerally repellent due to the viciousness of the killers crimesfor the first murder he feeds a man for days until his stomach burstsbut it is more horrific than gory. It comes as a surprise watching the film more closely in later viewings that so much of what we thought we saw the first time is never shown.Foster Hirsch has high praise for the setting of Seven because it may well be the most richly rendered symbolic space to date in the history of neonoir. 8 However he concludes that Seven is compelling if morally hollow. 9 I would instead argue that Seven floods us with morality not all of it palatable. The fragmentation of narrative voice is extensive and the only authoritative storyteller we can cling to Somerset played by Morgan Freeman is the one who believes that the violent aspects of human nature are incomprehensible yet unstoppable. Frighteningly enough even the killer John Doe Kevin Spacey has a powerful and convincing voice in the film. He at least envisions an end to violence.Seven conforms to the definition of the progressive text as one that challenges the conventional means of representing reality in the cinema in such a way as to expose those means as a practice as a product of ideology and not as a manifest replication of reality. 10 This label is easier to apply to Fight Club 1999 where the style of the film directly influences characters and the narrative structure but the seeds of this visual progression are planted in Seven. The films protagonists detectives Somerset and Mills Brad Pitt are from two different worlds and the lens alternates between their two disparate perspectives. Somersets world is smoky and dark his crime scenes are littered with grime and decay and his precinct cluttered and cramped is a monument to unsolved cases. Mills approaches police work as a profession rather than a solemn duty. He has the hot cups of coffee the beautiful home and a beautiful wife Gwyneth Paltrow. His first crime scene is bright and media saturated and his attitude is reflected in the words that echo from a nearby television this will be the very definition of swift justice.Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji Jeunet and Caros Delicatessen  and City of Lost Children  worked to create a new aesthetic that would successfully convey the mood of the characters without falling into kitsch and clich. Khondji comments that they moved toward a roughness a grittiness and didnt worry about making things beautiful. 11 Towards this end Khondji applied a new resilvering process to the negatives revealing more grain in the celluloid and making the black impervious to light.The noir world and the clinical world of the policeprocedural compete until gradually Somersets historically proven pessimism wins out. It is unclear at which point the killer takes control of the film. Possibly he has always had the upper hand and we have simply been following his directions. At any rate we are certain that his final ghastly actshipping the head of Mills wife by courier to this final destination in the middle of nowheresymbolizes nothing but victory for Does machinations. Mills executes Doe shooting him several times. The fall of an innocent man is complete but we cant forget Does venomous remarks that only in a world this shitty could his victims be considered innocent. In most Hollywood serialkiller films the death of the madman at the end seems to tie up all the loose ends. In Seven Does execution fulfils his master plan he claims that he is a victim of envy and completes the story that he set out to tell. Somersets voiceover as the film closes cannot regain the confidence of the spectator and is unable to mitigate the impact of the tragedy.Following Seven Fincher was selected to direct The Game 1997. In this clever thriller Michael Douglas plays Nicholas van Orton a man of inherited wealth and privilege who is haunted by his fathers suicide and is in the midst of more than a simple midlife crisis as his 40th birthday approachesthe day when in his own life his father chose to jump to his death. So when his brother Sean Penn the neer do well son offers him the chance to sign up for a game that will change his lifeto make it funhe is curious enough to accept. After visiting the offices of CRS the administrators of the game a conspiracy unfolds that threatens his status and his life. His home is vandalized he discovers his briefcase in a hotel room filled with alarming Polaroids and cocaine he is driven into the river by a taxi driver who is in on the action and after being told that his most valuable bank accounts have been emptied he is drugged and left for dead in Mexico. The rules of the game were never laid out so we are in the same boat as Nicholas wondering if this is real or just an elaborate hoax.The Game is an apt title the audience is playing its own game as Van Orton is playing his. We happily sign ourselves over to the events we see on screen and are drawn through the absurd sequence of events without a second thought gaily eating up the illusions of the movementimage. Fincher exploits the game that is inherent in the noir mystery as we try to figure out the twist the trick ending. All the while he proudly displays the tools of his machination. Van Orton is being manipulated by costumes sets props characters and soap opera tragedies. This should highlight the fact that we are manipulated by these same elements. We should know better than to go along with it. But just because we know that we are watching a film doesnt make us any less susceptible to the illusion. If anything knowing the rules makes us even more gullible. Hirsch evaluates The Game as a dire prediction for the future of film noirIt is however a perilous model that if pursued could lead only to the death of noir. Treating the form as only a game as carnivalesque theatre of the absurd a sequence of what in retrospect are vaudevillian turns the film contains the seeds of the genres destruction. 12When noir is simply something that we use to confirm the pleasantness of the reality that we live in something in the language is certainly failing its potential. This is not to say that it will always fail. Certainly Finchers next film Fight Club confirms that there is still some revolutionary potential in the noir mode.Fight Club is possibly the only film in which a happy ending is comprised of the literal selfdestruction of the protagonist and the possible end of civilization. In this world the American Dream is even further out of reach than it was in the noir world of the 1940s but rather than fighting to obtain it Fight Clubs solution is to destroy it utterly.As Tyler Durden Brad Pitt and the unnamed narrator Edward Norton stroll down the street at night they hit obvious status automobiles with baseball bats. And the assaults do not stop there. Every form of consumption suffers mass casualties the computers coffee shops and furniture that we trade in as frequently as we change our underwear are blown to pieces. Fight Club declares as ethos something that the classical noir protagonists discovered long ago the quest for the Maltese Falcon or the Great Whatzit even when it succeeds is a failure. Rather than simply accept that there is no such thing as a fair fight Fight Club reinvokes it as a revolutionary gesture. The fights are without glory or explicit reward but all of the participants are willing and in fact pleased to be part of a physical conflict.In Fight Club the American Dream that the narrator has followed all his life is an illusion the remnants of it hang in the form of faded or bleached flags over the attendees at testicular cancer meetings or in the command center of Project Mayhem. Such a situation some would argue could lead to a loss of ones identity. The narrators identity crisis and his insomnia lead him to narrate the entire film as a list of alternating tragedies and banalities. Two of the structuring principles of film noir the flashback and the voiceover reflect the narrators confusion cynicism and narcissism. The narrators reason for telling us this story is the same as his reason for attending the selfhelp groups. He tells Marla the ostensible femme fatale When people think youre dying they really really listen to you instead of. Instead of just waiting for their turn to speak she says finishing his sentence. The narrator finds in us a receptive audience.This is not to say that we entirely trust the narrator. His words are filled with contradictions and a very subjective morality. The narrators condemnation of Marla is immediately ridiculous. After all his problem with Marla is that she is a tourist in the same selfhelp groups that he is frequenting under false pretences her lie reflected my lie he says bitterly. The narrators obsession with Marla shadows conveniently his obsession with Tyler.Because of the narrators fascination with Tyler and because our narrator knows what Tyler knows Marlas role in the film is almost incidental. Tyler is very much the homme fatale whose charismatic demeanor manipulates the actions of the narrator. Male sexuality is now as dangerous as female sexuality and attractive men are set up to inspire and to receive the gaze of the camera and of other charactersthat sexually appraising gaze formerly reserved for the sexual woman only. 13 After all it is Brad Pitts halfnaked body that dominates the film. While Tyler and the narrator sit in the bathroomTyler in the bathtub and the narrator nursing his woundsthey discuss their failed relationships with their fathers and seriously question the need for a heterosexual relationship. Tyler says Were a generation of men raised by women. Im wondering if another woman is really what we need.Fight Club constantly exhibits the battle for the narrative voice even if it is not apparent until after the narrators revelation that he and Tyler are actually the same person. Karen Hollingers observations on the impact of the voiceover in film noir are pertinent in this context. She writesVoiceover creates this fragmenting effect by establishing within the film a fight for narrative power as the narrator struggles to gain control of the narrative events recounted. This battle between the narrator and the films flashback visuals leads to an extreme tension between word and image. 14Fight Club is told as a flashback with occasional footnotes. The narrator reminisces while Tyler shoves a gun in his mouth. The unnamed narrator speaks while Tyler periodically dips his hand in to dally with the visual images. Tylers subjectivity adopts a reflexive edge. He controls the very medium of the story. Frames of Tyler are spliced into the film that we are watching we later realize what these are when our narrator tells us of Tylers penchant for splicing single frames of pornography into childrens films and during his most impassioned speech the film jumps the sprockets of the projector. Realizing the inherent contradiction between Hollywood film as an escapist medium and noir language as a subversive mode Fincher calls on more radical techniques to get his point across.According to Gavin Smith Fight Club belongs to a distinct moment of both dread and rupture in American mainstream cinema. 15 His comments echo the words of those early critics who mapped out the territory of film noir. But times have changed. Fight Club is packaged to make us drool. After watching it we want to buy the theatre not burn it down. Maybe Tyler Durdens sermon to just let go is the ultimate solution but it will take more than a vicarious journey of selfdiscovery to make it happen.Finchers most recent film Panic Room 2002 is more conventional than any of his previous films. It is in the words of the films producer Scott Rudin a cheesy popcorn movie produced within an inch of its life. 16 It is a concept film a womantrappedinahouse film. I wont say too much about it other than to applaud Finchers attempt to make a perfect film and to critique it for being too simple to convincingly fill 90 minutes. The plot revolves around a home invasion robbery which finds Meg Altman Jodie Foster and her daughter Sarah Kristen Stewart trapped in the safe room of their New York brownstone townhouse. The three intruders of course want to steal something that is in the panic room. The film presents the battle to control this home space. It hinges on knowing what the enemy is up to. Surveillance is key. The camera glides through walls and floors down airshafts and through keyholes to create a clear geography of the home and its occupants. The suspense hangs on these effects and largely succeeds. But with the exception of how well the cast holds the film together theres nothing to it. There is no edge no question nothing left unsaid. Frankly Panic Room has all of us Fincher fans a little concerned. We dont go to sleep any easier these nights knowing that Lords of Dogtowna film about skateboarders in Venice California in the 1970sis slated to be Finchers next project. But I shouldnt speak too soon. Fincher is full of surprises.FilmographyThe Beat of the Live Drum 1985Alien 3 1992Seven 1995The Game 1997Fight Club 1999Panic Room 2002BibliographyRaymond Borde and tienne Chaumeton Towards a Definition of Film Noir in Alain Silver and James Ursini eds Film Noir Reader New York Limelight Editions 1996 Fifth ed. 1999 pp. 1726Foster Hirsch Detours and Lost Highways A Map of NeoNoir New York Limelight Editions 1999Karen Hollinger Film Noir Voiceover and the Femme Fatale in Alain Silver and James Ursini eds Film Noir Reader New York Limelight Editions 1996 Fifth ed. 1999 pp. 243260Barbara Klinger CinemaIdeologyCriticism Revisited The Progressive Genre in Barry Keith Grant ed Film Genre Reader Austin University of Texas Press 1986 pp. 7490Ron Magid Alien 3 In Space Theyre Still Screaming American Cinematographer 73 July 1992 pp. 5258Christopher Probst Playing for Keeps on The Game American Cinematographer 78 September 1997 pp. 3952Jonathan Romney The New Paranoia Games Pixels Play Film Comment November 1998 pp. 3943Paul Schrader Notes on Film Noir in Alain Silver and James Ursini eds Film Noir Reader New York Limelight Editions 1996 Fifth ed. 1999 pp. 5364Gavin Smith Inside Out Gavin Smith Goes OneonOne with David Fincher Film Comment 35 5 SeptemberOctober 1999 pp. 5868.Amy Taubin Invading Bodies Aliens 3 and the Trilogy Sight and Sound 2 3 March 1992 pp. 910David E.

This time around well be talking about Alien 3 the 1992 trilogy capper that should have oneupped James Camerons Aliens 1986 just as that film managed to outdo Ridley Scotts original from 1979. Known for its several scrapped scripts and overwhelming studio intervention Alien 3 also marked the directorial feature debut of an upandcoming filmmaker by the name of David Fincher.Ever heard of himAt that time Fincher was only known for directing music videos and no one could have guessed just how celebrated of an auteur he would become in the years to follow. However the third Alien movie wasnt the best Hollywood resume builder as the designbycommittee approach the death of Hicks and Newt at the very start and a sometimes unconvincing Xenomorph puppet composited into certain scenes with some CGI sprinkled in all culminated in a critical and box office flop an occurrence the Alien IP had never seen before. Up until the early 90s the franchise had to quote the Nostromos Ash been a perfect organism.In the years since Alien 3s release and negative reception fans have sort of warmed up to the project not regarding it as a total mess. Even so Fincher has disowned the movie and refuses to speak about it in any capacity. Three years later his prestigious reputation would begin to take shape with the release of S7ven.But what happened in that alternate reality where Alien 3 was not only a worth followup to Aliens but a true realization of David Finchers unique and often dark filmmaking style What if hed been given a free reignMORE FOR YOUWhere To Find Donald Trumps Hot New SneakersTrue Detective Night Country Episode 6 Review  A Truly Embarrassing Season FinaleGoogle Teases Innovative New Android Abilities With Gemini AI20th Century FoxLooking back it was a very very very bumpy ride for everyone Lucinda Syson CSA who worked as a casting assistant to Priscilla John on the film told me during a phone interview. I think David Fincher turned out to be an absolute genius and I think sometimes there is this old fashioned thing about youthful firsttimers or whatever not really knowing what theyre doing but I think he was an inspired genius and was kind of overshadowed by some of the filmmaking protocol. That film couldve been much of that sort of Edgar Allan Poe style. It was heading in that direction and I think that if David had been given his way it would have turned out great. I mean he was exploring too at that point. Coming out the other side of that film he went on to S7ven and blew everyones minds and so I think if hed been allowed a little bit more of his own reign in the first one I think it wouldve been a different film.Since that baptism by fire as she calls it Syson has gone on to become an extremely accomplished and talented casting director assembling actors and ensembles for major projects like XMen First Class Mission Impossible  Rogue Nation Wonder Woman and the remake of Aladdin. Shes also the casting director for Wonder Woman 1984 Terminator Dark Fate and the currentlyuntitled Game of Thrones prequel project about to start filming for HBO. Before you ask I did try to get her to tease those things and she was as you might guess incredibly tightlipped.Lets just say theyre all brilliant and Im thrilled to be part of them. Im absolutely thrilled to be part of those projects. I feel very privileged she said.20th Century FoxGetting back to Alien 3 though the plot revolves around Ellen Ripley Sigourney Weaver crashlanding on a prison planet inhabited by condemned criminals who get a shot at redemption when a Xenomorph gets loose on the compound. In addition to Weaver the cast also includes Charles Dance Charles S. Dutton Pete Postlethwaite and Lance Henriksen.Things get even more complicated when Ripley learns that she is playing host to a Xenomorph Queen and ends up sacrificing herself before the organism can fall into the wrong hands.It was a very rocky road and incredible to be there for David Finchers firstever feature Syson added. I think I learned an enormous amount on that film because I was on the set.

This in itself wasnt especially surprising as Finchers productions seem to attract crises of the cosmicjoke variety be they midshoot injuries Se7en lastminute casting switcheroos Panic Room or onthefly script rewrites Alien3. Despite the directors meticulous planninghe can spend years preparing for a filmsomething usually goes awry. Hes used to it. All movies are a trial he says matteroffactly. Its war.But this latest battle was unique. In a roundabout way it had to do with ABBA.For much of the past year Fincher has been filming The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo his roughly 100 million adaptation of the macabre Swedish mystery that centers on a punkhacker heroine with distinctive skin art. On one of the first nights of shooting Fincher and his crew were in Sweden filming a murder scene that takes place alongside a gloomy dock. But after a nights work Fincher didnt have the shot he wanted and the films ultratight schedule meant he wouldnt be able to return for months.When Fincher began planning the reshoot he learned that the property had been sold to one of the guys in ABBA. Apparently the new ownereither Benny or Bjrn its not really clearwasnt thrilled at the prospect of having his evening stroll interrupted by a simulated drowning and he refused to let the crew come back. Rather than find a new location or make do with the footage he had Fincher decided to build his own Swedish dock.Which is why on a latesummer afternoon were standing on a Los Angeles soundstage examining a replica of a ruralScandinavia miseenscne mossy rocks foliagefat trees andperched high above the docks turtlenecking out of the woodsa squat deceptively cozy faux cottage. Like most sets it looks a bit weird naked. But once the lights hit and the smoke drifts in we are suddenly in the land of stunted summers and moderately high suicide rates.The mass murder and hatesex in Dragon Tattoo is proof that your mom has been reading some weird stuff lately.As usual though Fincher is not satisfied. He stands in the middle of the stage arms folded a coffee stirrer clenched in his teeth. Hes 49 and trim dressed in dark jeans a gray polo and sneakers his mouth framed by a neat turf of mostly salty saltandpepper whiskers. He then starts pacing the set calmly relaying what needs to be changed tuneups that range from the subtle to the barely perceptible a branch thats sagging a few inches too low a pair of lightbulbs with mismatched wattages a patch of leaves that needs to be a little bit darker.Most viewers wont notice the way the pebbles are scattered or how high the watermarks rise on the fake rocks. But Fincher will. Even in an industry full of control freaks Fincher stands out as obsessivea guy who will scrutinize and engineer every element in the frame until the images on the screen fit the ones in his head. Sometimes that means repainting a few leaves sometimes it means doing 50 60 even 100 takes of a single scene.Dragon Tattoo is Finchers ninth film in two decades. And while the movies often focus on darkhearted subjectsmadness Se7en paranoia The Game nihilism Fight Club greed Panic Room obsession Zodiac and betrayal The Social Networktheyre always beautiful to look at. Each is packed with so much careful detailphysical aural spatialwhile also being so clean and composed that hes earned his own fanboybestowed sobriquet Fincheresque.Like middle class and pornography the term is knowitwhenyouseeit elastic but its usually pinned on a scene thats darkly lit darkly themed and eerily beautiful. Think of the flashlights sabering through a shutins filthy apartment in Se7en or the skyscrapers exploding and folding like glass accordions at the end of Fight Club.Moments like these have established Fincher as one of Hollywoods few accessible auteurs a guy who can make commercially viable movies without 2s in their title and who never sacrifices his artful cynicism for phony uplift. There arent a whole lot of directors trying to find the balance between commerce andloath as I am to say itart Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker says. Somehow he manages to make something incredibly handcrafted and heartfelt on a big budget.But Finchers bleak yet captivating visions might also be why despite all his success hes never had an Inceptionsize boxoffice smash. Even a movie like Se7en which pulled in 300 million worldwide had the aura of a cult hit if only because it felt weird to enthuse openly about a movie in which a pregnant womans decapitated head is stuffed into a box. My whole career has been pervy books pervy scripts Fincher says only half kidding. It wasnt so much about finding a niche. It just didnt seem to me like there was any need to be doing more of what everyone else was doing. Its not that Finchers films arent belovedthey areits just that sometimes it take a while for audiences to come around to them. Its as if Fincher lives in the near future releasing movies a year or two before the world is ready for them.Alien3Finchers first feature. It started filming without a final script and was ultimately recut by the studio.Photo Everett CollectionAlien 3Photo Everett CollectionSE7ENFincher refused to soften the infamous ending.

Photo Everett Collection Anders Linden Baldur BragasonThe Girl With The Dragon TattooFincher began developing his CGintensive fable almost seven years before its release.Photo Everett CollectionThe Girl With The Dragon TattooPhoto Everett CollectionIt wasnt until The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in 2008 and The Social Network in 2010 that Fincher made what could truly be called massmarket films. While neither was exactly upbeatBenjamin Button is the story of a man aging in reverse and The Social Networks IPOsbeforebros maneuverings and legal takedowns were as brutal as anything in Fight Clubthey were audiencepleasing efforts and both earned Fincher Oscar nominations for best director.Now with Dragon Tattoo Fincher is going further plugging into a presold globally recognizable megaproperty. Stieg Larssons densely written in every sense of the word yet hardtoputdown thriller follows a disgraced journalist played by Daniel Craig and an outcast hacker The Social Networks Rooney Mara as they team up to investigate a 40yearold missingpersons case. Before its over theyll have discovered a warped fiefdom of mass murder and hatesex and youll have discovered that your mom has been reading some really weird shit lately.In many ways Dragon Tattoo is the biggest movie of Finchers career. Its the first time since his debutAlien3that he has committed himself to a fanatically awaited popculture property Larssons novels are easily the most feverishly devoured books since the Twilight series. If the movie works Fincher could very well be looking at his first franchise not to mention a third Oscar nomination. Sony optioned Craig and Mara for the second and third installments though Fincher hasnt been announced yet as their director. Most important the movie could finally nudge Fincher into the realm of Spielberg and Scorsesebankable filmmakers who can define and mine the zeitgeist simultaneously and who get to do whatever they want. And for Fincher getting to do whatever he wants is worth going to war for.I meet Fincher at a very strange time in his life in part because hes allowing me to meet him at all. Even as Se7en and The Game became hits in the mid to late 90sright around the time when directors like Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson were becoming auteur superstarsFincher kept a determinedly low profile. I dont enjoy doing interviews because I dont like being part of the noise he tells me one afternoon as we drive between Dragon Tattoos LA sets. I just dont want to be grist for the mill.In person Fincher is casually friendly. He says dude and peace more than youd expect and says fuck about as often as youd expect considering hes trying to get a massively expensive tentpole movie into theaters by Christmas. And like his films Fincher is unexpectedly almost disruptively funny at one point while scouting a new location in LA he dryly jokes that private trailers will be needed for the actors because of Craigs chronic masturbation habit. Craig for his part calls the director very witty. Its a valve that needs letting off especially when youre doing scenes about anal rape.As a result of Finchers low visibilityand perhaps this was partly intendedhe has maintained a sort of scarywunderkind mystique. The few known facts about the director make him seem such an unbelievable prodigy that even today they are like the stuff of fan fiction that he lived down the street from George Lucas. Or that he skipped college and found a job at Industrial Light  Magic working on movies like Return of the Jedi. Or that by his early twenties he was already overseeing video shoots with majorlabel budgets and giant crews.But it all happened. And when you look at how Fincher grew upin Marin County California in the early 70ssuddenly its hard to imagine it not happening. By then so many directors had set up shop in the San Francisco areaLucas Francis Ford Coppola Philip Kaufman Invasion of the Body Snatchers Michael Ritchie The Candidatethat filmmaking seemed like a plausible even admirable career path. None of the kids in my neighborhood wanted to be doctors or lawyers he says. They all wanted to be moviemakers.Finchers father was an author and a bureau chief for Life magazine his mother was a mentalhealth nurse who worked in a methadone clinic. At home theyd discuss their work with Fincher. My parents didnt keep much from me he says. They were like Heres the world youre going out into.They also encouraged their son to follow his singular precociously realized goal to make movies. In the third grade Fincher was already taking an elementaryschool film class a few years later he was directing super8 movies with his friends. Figuring film school would be a waste of time he worked his way into a job at ILM in 1982 when he was 20. He knew what he wanted remembers Terry Chostner an ILM vet who was on staff with Fincher. He kept telling people he was going to be a director. And this from a kid who wasnt even drinking age.Fincher made his transition to directing by moving to LA to work in the nascent and largely lookeddownupon musicvideo industry. One of his earliest efforts was Rick Springfields Bop Til You Drop a Mad Maxcribbing dystopicJazzercise fantasy that involved slave labor alien overlords and laser beams. Though the clips ominous story line was completely incongruous with the songs probop message the video established many of the hallmarks of Finchers early directorforhire career lightbathed visuals budgetstraining production values and a linear if only quasilogical narrative.Fincher didnt have much love for music videos and he especially loathed doing commercials and still does though sometimes he will make onetheyre awful he says and they involve all sorts of bizarre bureaucratic checks and balancesbut each assignment got him one step closer to making movies and the money was spectacular.David Fincher stubborn dark obsessive.Photo Merrick MortonAfter cofounding the famed production company Propaganda Films which went on to produce works by directors from Michael Bay to Spike Jonze Fincher directed dozens of clips throughout the 80s and early 90s each increasingly daring and expensive Madonnas Express Yourself a sweatglistened rainsoaked homage to Fritz Langs Metropolis Aerosmiths Janies Got a Gun a disturbing childabuse tale with a policeprocedural story line and Don Henleys The End of the Innocence a crisp blackandwhite portrait of Reaganera hardship influenced by photographer Robert Franks famed 50s travelogue The Americans. Theres always been a deep humanism to Davids work says director Greg Gold one of Propagandas founders. Even the characters in his music videos had depth.Finchers Propaganda duties often required him to deal with label brass and ad agencies something he didnt enjoy particularly when they got in the way of his ideas. An ad exec might show up at a Fincher shoot and find out he was banned from his own set. Nosy recordlabel employees were circumvented or simply ignored. He was opinionated and difficult says Sigurjn Sighvatsson another of Propagandas founders. But he wasnt arrogant. He was confident. Kim Dempster who helped produce several of Finchers early projects remembers the shoots as being extremely stressful. You had to have it together for him. It was much harder than working for other directors but it was a much better product.When I mention an early 90s Advertising Age article about his supposed strongheadedness Fincher dismisses the claimthough he doesnt exactly deny it either. Youre supposed to have an idea of what it is youre trying to do right he says. Arent you being overpaid to have that My job is to know what the fuck I want.Finchers headquarters is a neatly outfitted modernist building in Los Angeles Little Armenia district. Inside his office theres a Where the Wild Things Are  skateboard a massive coffee table book dedicated to Stanley Kubricks neverfilmed Napoleon biopic and a Segway. On his desk is a blackandwhite printout of a scantily clad Mara the actress playing the hacker in Dragon Tattoo with a computer mouse covering her genitals. Fincher wonders if it might work to illustrate this story.What are your bosses like he asks. Are they corporate suckasses afraid of their own shadowAt first it might seem odd that Fincher would still be raging at corporate suckassery His advertising clients have included such behemoths as ATT and Levis and unlike many of his contemporariesSteven Soderbergh David O. Russellhes never made a movie outside of the studio system. He has certainly been well compensated by the corporate fat cats he claims to loathe at one point in the mid80s he says Propaganda was billing nearly 80 million a year. Undoubtedly a reasonable portion of that ended up in his pocket.Perhaps Fincher clings to his deep antiauthority streak because it has always served as a crucial motivatoralmost a muse. It started back in grade school when he bristled at the idea of being required to study nonfilm subjects and it continued through his video and commercial career. He was always a rebel Propagandas Sighvatsson says. He was always fighting with somebody whether it was the establishment or whatever. Always challenging the status quo.But whatever animosity Fincher harbored toward corporate power was surely cemented by his experiences making Alien3. Released in 1992 Finchers first movie tells the story of Sigourney Weavers beloved Ripley character being stranded in an allmale outer space penal colony where she shaves her head learns shes pregnant with an alien and eventually kills herself by falling slow motion into a giant vat of molten lava. Alien3 was pounded by critics and largely ignored by audiences the only way it could have done worse would have been if theyd actually called it AllMale Outer Space Penal Colony.Fincher hates talking about Alien3 which started filming without a finished script and plunged him into daily battles with 20th Century Fox over control in the end the studio recut Finchers version. At midnight hed have to get on the phone with Fox and justify shooting the next days work remembers Weaver. I think it hurt his feelings and was exhausting.Several years later Fincher made nice with Fox and somehow persuaded the studio to bankroll Fight Club his caustic anticorporate buddy comedy about an unnamed culturally emasculated claims adjuster Edward Norton and a charismatic anarchist named Tyler Durden Brad Pitt who form an underground brawling leagueterrorist coop. Adapted from a novel by Chuck Palahniuk Fight Club was grotesquely violent unnervingly kinetic and darkly funny. The mere existence of Fight Club is kind of a jokea treatise on the neutering effects of corporate America underwritten by an international media conglomerate. We were making a satire Fincher says. We were saying This is as serious about blowing up buildings as The Graduate is about fucking your moms friend.Released in 1999 the movie caused a bipartisan freakout Conservatives condemned its violence while Hollywood liberals complained that it focused unwanted attention on shootemup films and TV in the months following Columbine. For Fincher this was all a point of pride. Theres a quote from a film critic that David had enlarged framed and hung in his conference room says Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin. It calls Fight Club amoral and Godless. I think hed rather have that quote than a Palme dOr.Though Fight Club was only a modest success in theaters it has sold millions of DVDs. Watch the movie now and its easy to see why Fight Club has yet to age indeed its time may still not have truly arrived. The movie addressed buildyourlifearoundourbrand consumerism well before the cult of the iPod was founded and it provided an inadvertent blueprint for the sort of decentralized shitsandgiggles anarchy that would later be adopted by web collectives like Anonymous. When people watch it 50 years from now theyll probably assume it was made in 2011 or 2021 or whatever bleak period it will have turned out to presage.Fight Club also exemplifies Finchers curious relationship with the modern era Its a movie about the perils of IKEA furniture and luxe gadgetry directed by a Segwayriding gearhead. This is a paradox that runs through Finchers life and work. Hes a director raised on CG whos known for embracing new techniques and effects from the reverseaging wizardry in Benjamin Button to the subtle Winklevoss headswaps in The Social Network. Yet Fincher has never been sucked too deeply into the whimsyindulging physics bending cartoon rabbit hole of CGI that has engulfed directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas. And while his characters are frequently analytical brainiacs hackers coders claims adjusters theyre often also prisoners of modernity.Consider Panic Room in which Jodie Fosters character takes refuge inside a Sharper Imageindebted high tech steel sarcophagus. Or  The Social Network which contrasted Mark Zuckerbergs frictionless online communication with his fractured reallife friendships. Even the solitary decadeslong hunt for a serial killer in Zodiac can be seen as a cautionary tale about informational fixationan allegorical warning for the Internet age when a timesuck can become a lifesuck without your even noticing. In Finchers world the innovations that safeguard and enrich us are also the ones that do us in.Back on the set of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Maras angryhacker character Lisbeth is having her way with a treacherous Swede courtesy of an imposingly huge chrome vibrator with a serrating buzz that sounds less like a joy machine than an irked Taser. This is Finchers third attempt at the books infamous raperevenge scene one of the key plot points in Larssons story.As it turns out Im not supposed to be here Because the scene is so intense this is a closed setlimited to essential cast and crew only. Before walking me in Fincher makes me promise not to tell Mara Im on set then promptly finds me a seat right next to hers. I cant help but wonder if its a semiplayful attempt to unnerve me. He denies this later though Im not sure I believe him. He is quite mischievous Mara says a few weeks afterward laughing. But we were all pretty desensitized at that point.Fincher thought film school would be a waste of time. Instead of going to college he worked his way into a job at ILM.The relatively atease atmosphere on the Dragon Tattoo set is surprising not only because of the subject matter but because stories of Finchers endurancetest directing style are legendary How he made Jake Gyllenhaal perform in Zodiac with a high fever how he put Mara and Jesse Eisenberg through more than 90 takes of The Social Networks opening breakup scene. Challenging people Mara says is one of his greatest joys in life.Finchers reasoning for putting his actors and crew through so many takes is simple Making a movie requires flying people thousands of miles putting them up in hotels and spending days building sets. Whats the point of all that preparation if youre just going to do your scene three timesAs grueling as it might seem to work under Fincher he inspires loyalty among many of his actors and crew members. Rigidity after all also doubles as structure. When youre working with somebody you trust theres a really nice feeling of just submitting to their goals says Eisenberg who got an Oscar nomination for his role in The Social Network.This confidence isnt limited to actors. He really is the best technician Ive ever worked with ever says Jodie Foster who has directed four films. He knows more about making movies than anybody Ive ever met. He pretty much knows everybody elses job better than they do.Still at times Fincher has played God a bit too ferociously. At one point while filming Panic Rooma production so tense according to Finchers DVD commentary that some people freaked out and needed to be escorted off the set Fincher wont get into specificsFoster stood with him behind a monitor watching him agonize over each take. He looked at me and he was like I just dont know anymore she says. Im like You know what I usually see what youre going for. This time I dont see the difference between take two and take seven. And hes like Oh my God. Im crazy arent I He recognizes it. He knows he has an issue. But he has to be 100 percent comfortable with the scene.Fortunately perhaps for Finchers current cast members there hasnt been quite as much time for such micromanaging on Dragon Tattoo. Its his fourth film in five years and it came together rather quicklysurprising given its many ostensible obstacles. For starters theres the fact that film versions of Larssons three Girl books have already been produced in Sweden and are readily available on Netflix. And the movie came with an unwigglable holidayseason deadline.There was also the material itself a return to the gritty settings of Finchers early career. I try to choose things that arent a rehash of places Ive been he says. But I liked the idea of these two people navigating this odd world thousands of miles away. That was more interesting to me than the notion of Oh look more depravity.And hooooo boy is the Dragon Tattoo book depraved sample sentence The killer concluded his barbarities by shoving a parakeet up her vagina. Its also unevenly written. For the first 100 pages or so its almost impossible to believe Larssons series has become a top choice for bookclubbers and frequentfliers around the world.But oddly enough once you finish it you cant wait to see the movie. Maybe its the animosityflecked charge between the lead characters or the monstrous yet recognizably human villainy or the way it makes computer hacking seem like such a weirdly sexy calling. Theres something undeniably dank and alluring about Dragon Tattoo something almost  Fincheresque. With its sunless settings multipronged cruelty and emotionally bruised tech addicts its impossible to imagine any other director making it.In fact Larssons gruesome work might never have found such a huge audience if Fincher hadnt long ago snipped off our eyelids and shown us the entrenched nastiness around us. Fifteen years earlier he would have had to fight to make a film as twisted as Dragon Tattoo now its set to be a holiday blockbuster. David Finchers future it seems has finally arrived.Its an early morning in Hollywood and Fincher is listening to the words of a ghostIf a dove is the sinners offering the priest shall wring off its head cleave its wings and burn it upon the altar.Were in a sound studio where dialog for Dragon Tattoo is being recorded. In the corner of the room standing at a microphone is Moa Garpendal a fairskinned longstemmed Swedish actress who plays Harriet the teenager whose mysterious disappearance sets Dragon Tattoo in motion. As she reads the linea short bit of voiceover that appears halfway through the storyFincher paces the floor making eye contact only when he has a suggestion.A little more finality at the end he says. Bring your voice down.She gives it another reading. Lets do one more Fincher says. Read it like a recipe. If you do this then you have to do this then this.More tries more notes.Give me a little more wring off and cleave just to make it more punitive.Try to make the inhale a little bit softer.Good. Do one more.Sometimes Fincher raises his glasses and pinches his eyes closed shutting out everything but the sound. Whatever hes listening for this morning whatever way the words fall together in his head will not be arrived at quickly. At one point he catches a noise deep in the background of the track and halts the session. Are you hearing that Fincher asks the room. It was like a truck passing.They listen. There doesnt seem to be anything there.Maybe Im having a stroke Fincher says shrugging. Lets do one more.They try again the words rising into the air over and over again finally landing somewhere only David Fincher can hear them.Contributing editor Brian Raftery brianraftery gmail.com wrote about TV producer Dan Harmon in issue 19.10.Go Back to Top.

Finchers directing chops are never in question and Gillian Flynns novel is perhaps perfectly suited for his particular skill set. Gone Girl combines his instinctual way around pitchblack thrillers Se7en Zodiac The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and offbeat grimy comedies Fight Club and delivers 148 compelling minutes without any evident lull. 	While Fincher and Flynn deserve a ton of credit there were plenty of people who helped bring Flynns2012 best seller to crackling life. Four of these individuals arelongtime collaborators of his cinematographer Jeff Cronenworth his sixth Fincher film production designer Donald Graham Burt five previous collaborations and composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross their third collaboration. Through these collaborators well take a quick spoilerladen look athow they helped Fincher and Flynn find their cinematicGone Girl.	Again folksspoilers below. Menacing McMansions	Production designer Donald Graham Burt deserves a ton of credit for helping Fincher turnNicks hometown of Carthage Missouri into a placeof surface comforts and deep troubles. Burt won an Oscar for Art Direction for his work on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Fincher and while his work here is more subtle audiences will react to the world of confining comfort he has helped craft around Nick Ben Affleck and Amy Dunne Rosamund Pike.	The film was shot in Cape Girardeau a Missouri river town a little more than 100 miles outside of St. Louis. Nick and Amys life in Carthage is superficially perfect  two attractive people living in a big house in a nice part of town  but the true picture is one of debt increasing desperation and isolation. Cape Girardeau gave Burt a mixture of pretty McMansions and leafy suburbs lower income areas abandoned storefronts and a hodgepodge of architectural designs. Everything about Cape Girardeau was right Burt said in the press notes. From its mix of different levels of economics and period architectures from the 60s 70s and 80s to its sprawling malls to having the river there as an anchor.	The most important location of all was the Dunne household a large place where Nick and Amy could share a home but remained apart something not too ostentatiously huge and vulgar but one that upon closer inspection seems to be falling apart. The house they settled on had elements like the wood that seemed of a piece with the beautiful New York brownstone they had to give up but in a skewed way Burt said. Its as if the house yearns to be traditionalbut the hardware and the light fixtures and the vinyl windows give it away.	The house itself is schizophrenic a place with large rooms a beautifully appointed bedroom a fetching all glass showeryet nothing that happens in these spaces matches the rich reasonable suburban milieu. From the moment Nick comes home to the broken glass coffee table and signs of a struggle and no Amy the Dunne household slowly begins to reveal itself as the place where everything came unraveled a large superficially beautiful insane asylum. Favorite Spoilery Moment in the Dunne HouseholdThe bloody shower that Amy and Nick take togethera sort of reversePsychothat leaves Nick sputtering in confusion at his wifes lunacy.There was something so unsettling about such a creepy moment in such a Bed Bath  Beyondlike bathroom. The Sound of a Massage Going Horribly Horribly Awry	Having honed their process with Fincher over The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross happily cop to a method that takes much much longer than what would be usual but which bears such wonderfully strange and potent sounds. Starting on the score long before they see a single reel of the film an unusual way to work for a composer the two musicians continuously hone their work as Fincher and his team stitch the film together. We work almost subconsciously based often just on textures and swatches Reznor said in the production notes. After a few weeks of working this way well turn in some music to see if what we are doing is resonating with whats in Davids head. It probably takes about 30 times as long to work in this way but its what feels right.	The score feels very right perfect in fact and cements the FincherReznorRoss collaboration as one of modern cinemas most exciting directorcomposer collaborations along with Paul Thomas Anderson and Jonny Greenwood and youll get to know them better in the coming months and years Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz.	Fincher told The Wall Street Journal that he got an idea for the score while getting his back adjusted at a spa I was listening to that calming placating music and thought We need to tap into this. The movie is about the faade of the good neighbor the good Christian the good wife. Reznor said that this massage table music idea was the kick off point for the score. We thought what if we start with something that is almost grotesquely sweet and then reveal whats under the surface. We incorporated spalike moments but then explored how to make them turn unpleasant to peel off the layers so you feel the unraveling.	Reznor and Ross known for their virtuosity downscaled their typically robust synthetic soundscape to create something more organic using homemade equipment. At one point you hear an odd tapping sound that is almost like a heart beating a little Edgar Allen Poe The TellTale Heartstyle. It is just Reznor tapping on a wooden box.	The soundtrack starts off sweet and gentle but as Nick Dunnes life unravels the dark hints evident even in those early peacefulseeming sounds begin to grow. By the films end we are well below the surface of placid Suburban Missouri and the facile sweetness of thoseearly songs. Now were wriggling around in a sonic landscape as twisting and unpredictable as Amy Dunne herself.	If you want to listen to Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosss entire soundtrack for Gone Girl click here. The Eye of the Beholder	A ramshackle abandoned mansion in a rat infested industrial zone outside of a city. A storied Ivy league campus turned into twisted playground for a gifted troubled genius. A spotless impeccably designed mansion sitting atop a basement of horrors. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenworth has gone with David Fincher in so many memorably dark directions from Fight Club to The Social Network to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoothat its no surprise he was able to turn a quaint Missouri town into a place seething with secrets and fraying at the edges.	Described as a noir Americana and inspired by the photography of Joel Sternfeld who most famous photographic work American Prospects included color photos of barren landscapes and ruined towns Cronenworth used his considerable skills to turn the American Midwest into a place of hidden dark dimensions.	You look for ways to take a traditional mundane small town and a couples interpersonal home and subtly transform them into something mysterious Cronenworth said. He went on to describe Carthage as a dusty old wedding gown thats been kept in the closet.	One of the ways Cronenworth made the Dunnes home a discomfiting place was through light. The Dunnes house was all about taking a normal ordinary domestic situation and turning it into an isolated fortress with the blinds drawn down. From small details comes that sense of disenchantment. Another was by shooting many scenes from slightly below eyelevel catching a snatch of the ceiling above Nicks head to make him feel caged in his predicament.	To pick justonespoilerystandout moment among many theres theone and only gory scene in the entire film which begins with Amy treating Desi Neil Patrick Harris to some rough sex and ends with the incredible shot of her straddling him covered in his blood. WIll she start weeping at what shes done Nope just a flick of the head to get her her hair out of her eyes.MostPopularJanuary 29 2024Two New Dune Part Two Teasers Arrive as Tickets Go on SaleFebruary 2 2024Brad Pitt Nearing Role in Quentin Tarantinos Next Film The Movie CriticJanuary 25 2024Road House Trailer Reveals Jake Gyllenhaal vs Conor McGregor in Ferocious RemakeABOUT THE AUTHORBryan AbramsBryan Abrams is the Editorinchief of The Credits.Hesrun thesite since itslaunch in 2012.

Dark in content dark in tone and especially dark in visual aesthetics. Characters are shrouded in low light levels even in direct sunlight. Its ominous dread inducing and spectacular. It also bucks the trend of high contrast blueteal blockbuster looks that have been almost unavoidable in Films and TV for the last 10 years.I recently completed a color grade on Zombie Night a feature film starring Darryl Hannah and Anthony Michael Hall in which I applied a similar look that emphasized a darker feel with reduced highlights and color casts to set the tone. Here are some examples from Mr. Finchers last 3 films that showcase this lookand a color palette board from the film I just graded.House of Cards in Washington D.C. Metro rail stationThe Godfather is commonly referenced as one of the first films to break from conventional cinematography and go dark. Gordon Willis ASC was named The Prince of Darkness for his conscious decision to use low light levels and soft overhead lighting. He went as far as opting for not having the reflection of lights in the eyes of the actors. The studios were not happy director Francis Ford Coppola was worriedbut the resulting cinematography and impact of the film speaks for itself. The tone and dramatic weight of the epic story were aided and elevated by the Mr. Willis breathtaking work.The Godfather proved less is more in lighting dark scenesDavid Fincher is well known for his striking visual style and the immersive worlds he creates. Ive been lucky enough to work in his offices and speak with Academy Award winning editors Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter who cut The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Their attention to detail and level of absolute perfection is second to none. Nothing that ends up on the screen is accidental or arbitraryevery frame is dissected and decided upon. In my viewFinchers visuals have leaned towards a more natural realistic yet absolutely visceral feel over his last 3 projects. Lets take a peek at what that entailsThe Social NetworkNatural yet stylized images from The Social NetworkFrom the first scene in a bara new aesthetic was displayed in The Social Network. Its darkbut not with crushed blacks. As a viewer there is a difference between crushed blacks and compressed dynamics of light. There is clear detail in the shadows but the highlights are lowered and colored. If 100 is pure white lightmany of the whites in Finchers last 3 projects are at 90 roughly which constricts the perceived latitude of the image. These whites are also tinted towards the overall color of the scene. Orange is infused into both day and night scenes in The Social Network. Often blue is the go to nighttime color but not so in The Social Network. There are no rulesits what feels right and I found it extremely effective here.The Girl With The Dragon TattooDark visuals for a dark story in The Girl With The Dragon TattooThe Girl With The Dragon Tattoo display a continuation of this visual palette. In the winter setting of ambiguous sunlight and endless nightFincher again compresses the whites and keeps clean and legible blacks. Even though so much occurs at nightthe viewer never struggles to see what is occurring or gets lost in the visuals. From glasslined offices to nighttime exterior excursionseverything is pristine and clearly visible even when the light levels are extremely low. This can attributed to the ample latitude of the RED camera the careful cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth and the color grade itself. The tinting of both orange and blue to entire scenes further blends the color palette of scenes and delivers a very hyperreal look. Its set in the real world but pushes the boundaries to enhance the drama of the story.House of CardsHouse of Cards further pushes the limits or darknessA new low is reached in House of Cards. Scenes play out in extreme darkness. At the inauguration of the Presidentthe scene is played out during the day but it feels and looks like midnight. The sunlight is white but it is so muted and desaturated that it seems like it is only there as a courtesy to illuminate the scene. The mids and blacks blend into each other to the point that the whole scene feels black and white. Kevin Spaceys character is framed dead center and looks to the camera during the shothe includes the viewer into his world and speaks directly to the camera. Its eerie creepy and supremely effective. I saw the raw RED footage at Finchers post production offices and all of it was perfectly exposed and dare I saybright. I can see that the final images were all a creative decision to push the limits and deliver the images that he saw in his head.During other daylight scenes the same approach is applied. Its never blinding sunshineonly the impression that it is daytime. To further imply the constricting and murky world of Washington politicsnighttime scenes often allow just enough information to barely make out the characters. We strain to see the emotions and thought process of the actors as they are blanketed by low light levels and no fill lights to make them pop. This is a new kind of realism in cinematography where conventional lighting is thrown out and the onus is on us to extract what we need from what little we can see. Its enoughbut barely. It makes the audience work and pay attention to keep up with the story. Visual darkness represents and defines the cutthroat morality of the series. I personally love it. Some dont. To each their own.GONE GIRLThe darkness gets deeper in GONE GIRLMost recently GONE GIRL 2014 continues and expands upon the darkness and shrouds the characters within world of buried secrets and impenetrable blackness. Make no mistakethe visual depiction is not murky or muddyit is a dismal colorful bleakness that infuses and envelops the film. It matches the tone of the tale.My takeaway from watching the last 4 projects by David Fincher is that hes utilizing quickly evolving technologies RED color correction LED lighting to redefine the visual boundaries of what is the minimum needed to represent and tell the story. Its bold and radically different from lets sayan episode of CSI or Transformers. Its reality enhanced and a new take on what is considered natural light filmmaking. Then in post productioncolor grading the midtones and highlights are lowered to bring down the overall brightness BUT most importantlythe blacks are never crushed so that the shadow detail is always retained. The final image is Dark Clarity and matches the mood and tone of his last 3 projects.Zombie NightFinallyhere are all 2050 color graded shots from the film Zombie Night which is scheduled to come out Halloween 2013. I chose to embody many of the principles and sensibilities that David Fincher used on my grade of the film. I will follow up with a more detailed examination and explanation of my post production process once the film comes out and Im allowed to share all my assets and workflow. Zombie Night was shot on RED and I had 9 days to grade the entire feature on Davinci Resolve in my home studio. I was given three 4TB drives and colored at 12 resolution to get realtime playback. A lot of coffee and vodka made the whirlwind 9 days fly by. I exported to ProRes HQ and kicked out a XML for the final online.Zombie Night  2050 RED shots color graded in 9 daysThank you for hanging on to the end and letting me ramble about only one of the aspects that contribute to the making of an effective film. Ive been watching the choices in David Finchers last 3 projects and thought it worthy to discuss in the way that I see it and its relevance in the current state of cinematography and storytelling.

Living in Baltimore having seen many real locations now onscreen Ive been fascinated with all things House of Cards  Social Network. You were spot on in illustrating how color can be such an emotive thing. Cant wait to see how this influenced your grading.

Im still working w DSLRs but cant wait to make the jump to REDs and C300s            August 12 2013            ReplyJason BowdachVery interesting seeing his visual style evolve and be adapted to the best technology to tell the story and represent the characters inner thoughts thought visuals. Interesting seeing all the shots from ur latest grade neat to see how the whole picture has some color continuity even using very small clips            August 12 2013            ReplyJason BowdachForgot to mention Id love to hear more about your edit and grading workflow for Zombie Night.

Feels like I discovered the lost magic lamp So much            October 8 2013            Replyhazem abdulrabI love this low level lighting look and it would be great if you did a tutorial on this color grading. I have a basic idea of how to do it but would like to see how you would do it. Also I read the low budget action cutting post you did and i cant wait to test that out especially cutting 2 frames before impact and Ill shoot at 22 fps.

His mother Claire Mae ne Boettcher was a mental health nurse from South Dakota who worked in drug addiction programs. His father Howard Kelly Jack Fincher 19302003 was an author from Oklahoma who worked as a reporter and bureau chief for Life magazine. When Fincher was two years old the family moved to San Anselmo California where he counted filmmaker George Lucas among his neighbors. He became fascinated with filmmaking at the age of eight and began making films on an 8mm camera. In a 2012 interview he saidI was eight years old and I saw a documentary on the making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It had never occurred to me that movies didnt take place in real time. I knew that they were fake I knew that the people were acting but it had never occurred to me that it could take ... four months to make a movie It showed the entire company with all these rental horses and moving trailers to shoot a scene on top of a train. They would hire somebody who looked like Robert Redford to jump onto the train. It never occurred to me that there were hours between each of these shots. The actual circus of it was invisible as it should be but in seeing that I became obsessed with the idea of How It was the ultimate magic trick. The notion that 24 still photographs are shown in such quick succession that movement is imparted from itwow And I thought that there would never be anything that would be as interesting as that to do with the rest of my life.As a teenager Fincher moved to Ashland Oregon where he attended Ashland High School. He directed plays and designed sets and lighting after school was a nonunion projectionist at Varsity Theatre and worked as a production assistant at the KOBI news station in Medford. He supported himself by working as a busboy dishwasher and fry cook.Careeredit19831991 Early workeditWhile establishing himself in the film industry Fincher was employed at John Kortys studio as a production head. Gaining further experience he became a visual effects producer working on the animated Twice Upon a Time 1983 with George Lucas. He was hired by Industrial Light  Magic ILM in 1983 as an assistant cameraman and matte photographer and worked on Return of the Jedi 1983 and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 1984. In 1984 he left ILM to direct a television commercial for the American Cancer Society that depicted a fetus smoking a cigarette.This quickly brought Fincher to the attention of producers in Los Angeles and he was soon given the opportunity to direct Rick Springfields 1985 documentary The Beat of the Live Drum. Set on a directing career Fincher cofounded production company Propaganda Films and started directing commercials and music videos. Other directors such as Michael Bay Antoine Fuqua Michel Gondry Spike Jonze Alex Proyas Paul Rachman Mark Romanek Zack Snyder and Gore Verbinski also honed their skills at Propaganda Films before moving on to feature films.Fincher directed TV commercials for many companies including Levis Converse Nike Pepsi Revlon Sony CocaCola and Chanel although he loathed doing them. Starting in 1984 Fincher began his foray into music videos. He directed videos for various artists including singersongwriters Rick Springfield Don Henley Martha Davis Paula Abdul rock band the Outfield and RB singer Jermaine Stewart. Finchers 1990 music video for Freedom 90 was one of the most successful for George Michael.He directed Michael Jacksons Who Is It Aerosmiths Janies Got A Gun and Billy Idols Cradle of Love. For Madonna he directed the videos for Express Yourself Oh Father Bad Girl and Vogue. The blackandwhite video for Vogue took inspiration from the films of the 1920s and 1930s and has been frequently cited as one of the best videos of all time. Between 1984 and 1993 Fincher was credited as a director for 53 music videos. He referred to the production of music videos as his own film school in which he learned how to work efficiently within a small budget and time frame.19922000 BreakthrougheditIn 1990 20th Century Fox hired Fincher to replace Vincent Ward as the director for the sciencefiction horror Alien 3 1992 his film directorial debut. It was the third installment in the Alien franchise starring Sigourney Weaver. The film was released in May 1992 to a mixed reception from critics and was considered weaker than the preceding films. From the beginning Alien 3 was hampered by studio intervention and several abandoned scripts. Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone called the film bold and haunting despite the struggle of nine writers and studio interference.The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. Years later Fincher publicly expressed his dismay and subsequently disowned the film. In the book Directors Cut Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century Fincher blames the producers for their lack of trust in him. In an interview with The Guardian in 2009 he stated No one hated it more than me to this day no one hates it more than me.After this critical disappointment Fincher eschewed reading film scripts or directing another project. He briefly retreated to directing commercials and music videos including the video for the song Love Is Strong by the Rolling Stones in 1994 which won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Shortly Fincher decided to make a foray back into film. He read Andrew Kevin Walkers original screenplay for Seven 1995 which had been revised by Jeremiah Chechik the director attached to the project at one point. Fincher expressed no interest in directing the revised version so New Line Cinema agreed to keep the original ending. Starring Brad Pitt Morgan Freeman Gwyneth Paltrow R. Lee Ermey and Kevin Spacey it tells the story of two detectives who attempt to identify a serial killer who bases his murders on the Christian seven deadly sins. Seven was positively received by film critics and was one of the highestearning films of 1995 grossing more than 320million worldwide. Writing for Sight and Sound John Wrathall said it stands as the most complex and disturbing entry in the serial killer genre since Manhunter and Roger Ebert opined that Seven is one of the darkest and most merciless films ever made in the Hollywood mainstream.Following Seven Fincher directed a music video for 6th Avenue Heartache by the Wallflowers and went on to direct his third feature film the mystery thriller The Game 1997 written by the duo John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Fincher also hired Seven screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker to contribute and polish the script. Filmed on location in San Francisco the story follows an investment banker played by Michael Douglas who receives an unusual gift from his younger brother Sean Penn where he becomes involved in a game that integrates with his everyday life making him unable to differentiate between game and reality. Almar Haflidason of the BBC was critical of the ending but praised the visualsFincher does a marvelous job of turning ordinary city locations into frightening backdrops where every corner turned is another step into the unknown. Upon The Games release in September 1997 the film received generally favorable reviews but performed moderately at the box office. The Game was later included in the Criterion Collection.In August 1997 Fincher agreed to direct Fight Club based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. It was his second film with 20th Century Fox after the troubled production of Alien 3. Starring Brad Pitt Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter the film is about a nameless office worker suffering from insomnia who meets a salesman and together form an underground fighting club as a form of therapy. Fox struggled with the marketing of the film and were concerned that it would have a limited audience. Fight Club premiered on October 15 1999 in the United States to a polarized response and modest box office success the film grossed 100.9 million against a budget of 63 million. Initially many critics thought the film was a violent and dangerous express train of masochism and aggression. However in following years Fight Club became a cult favorite and gained acknowledgement for its multilayered themes the film has been the source of critical analysis from academics and film critics.In 1999 Fincher was shortlisted by Columbia Pictures as one of the potential directors to helm SpiderMan 2002 a liveaction adaptation of the fictional comicbook character of the same name. Finchers pitch featured an older experienced version of the titular character in his adult years and the postadolescent portion of his life as a photographer and his crimefighting double life as a vigilante with a more grounded characterdriven and dramaoriented tone and direction. Fincher later said of his pitch I went in and told them what I might be interested in doing and they hated it. Sam Raimi was chosen as director instead.20012010 Continued successeditJesse Eisenberg and Fincher at the 2010 New York Film Festival.In 2001 Fincher served as an executive producer for the first season of The Hire a series of short films to promote BMW automobiles.

In other countries it grossed 100 million for a worldwide 196.4 million. Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the filmmakers for their fair degree of ingenuity... for 88 minutes of excitement and the convincing performance given by Foster. Fincher acknowledged Panic Room for being more mainstream describing the film Its supposed to be a popcorn moviethere are no great overriding implications. Its just about survival.Five years after Panic Room Fincher returned on March 2 2007 with Zodiac a thriller based on Robert Graysmiths books about the search for the Zodiac a real life serial murderer who terrorized communities between the late 1960s and early 1970s. Fincher first learned of the project after being approached by producer Brad Fischer he was intrigued by the story due to his childhood personal experience. The highway patrol had been following our school buses he recalled. His father told him Theres a serial killer who has killed four or five people... whos threatened to... shoot the children as they come off the bus.After extensive research on the case with fellow producers Fincher formed a principal cast of Jake Gyllenhaal Mark Ruffalo Robert Downey Jr. Anthony Edwards and Brian Cox. It was the first of Finchers films to be shot in digital with a Thomson Viper FilmStream HD camera. However highspeed film cameras were used for particular murder scenes. Zodiac was well received appearing in more than two hundred top ten lists only No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood appeared in more. However the film struggled at the United States box office earning 33million but did better overseas with a gross of 51.7million. Worldwide Zodiac was a moderate success. Despite a campaign by Paramount Pictures the film did not receive any Academy Award or Golden Globe nominations.In 2008 Fincher was attached to a film adaptation of the sciencefiction novel Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C. Clarke however Fincher said the film is unlikely to go ahead due to problems with the script. His next project was The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 2008 an adaptation of F.

The series based on the book Mind Hunter Inside the FBIs Elite Serial Crime Unit debuted on Netflix worldwide on October 13 2017. He has expressed interest in eventually making a third season of Mindhunter which was put on indefinite hold in 2020. In 2023 Fincher confirmed that Netflix will not be making a third season of Mindhunter saying Im very proud of the first two seasons. But its a very expensive show and in the eyes of Netflix we didnt attract enough of an audience to justify such an investment for Season 3.In June 2017 Jim Gianopulos of Paramount Pictures announced that a sequel to World War Z was in advanced development with Fincher and Brad Pitt. Producers Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner said that Fincher would begin directing it in June 2019. However in February 2019 Paramount cancelled the project.

It premiered at the 80th Venice International Film Festival. It began a limited theatrical release in October 2023 and was subsequently released on Netflix on 10 November.Filmmaking style and techniqueseditInfluenceseditFincher did not attend film school. He has listed filmmakers George Roy Hill Alfred Hitchcock Stanley Kubrick Alan J. Pakula Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese as his major influences. His personal favorite films include Rear Window 1954 Lawrence of Arabia 1962 The Graduate 1967 Paper Moon 1973 American Graffiti 1973 Jaws 1975 All the Presidents Men 1976 Taxi Driver 1976 Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 and Zelig 1983. He suggested that his film Panic Room is a combination of Rear Window and Straw Dogs 1971.For Seven Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji were inspired by films The French Connection 1971 and Klute 1971 as well as the work of photographer Robert Frank. He has cited graphic designer Saul Bass as an inspiration for his films title sequences Bass designed many such sequences for prominent directors including Hitchcock and Kubrick.MethodeditThose are the moments where moviemaking is not like writing and its not like the theater and its not like performance art and its not like sculpting. Its truly its own discipline. Theres nothing else like it in those moments where you go wow heres an intent that was probably never even thought of by the guy who wrote the book. And yet this person who may or may not have even read the source material has found this thing. That for me after the previsualization is the most exciting part of the whole.Fincher on serendipity during filmmaking.Finchers filmmaking process always begins with extensive research and preparation although he has said the process is different every time I enjoy reading a script that you can see in your head and then I enjoy the casting and I enjoy the rehearsal and I enjoy all the meetings about what it should be what it could be what it might be. He has admitted to having autocratic tendencies and prefers to micromanage every aspect of a films production. Icelandic film producer Sigurjn Sighvatsson with whom Fincher has collaborated for decades has said that Fincher was always a rebel... always challenging the status quo.Known for his perfectionism and meticulous eye for detail Fincher performs thorough research when casting actors to ensure their suitability for the part. His colleague Max Daly said Hes really good at finding the one detail that was missed. He knows more than anybody. Producer Laura Ziskin said of him Hes just scary smart sort of smarter than everyone else in the room. He approaches editing like intricate mathematical problems. Longtime collaborator Angus Wall said that editing Zodiac was like putting together a Swiss watch... all the pieces are so beautifully machined. He elaborated Fincher is incredibly specific. He never settles. And theres a purity that shows in his work.When working with actors Fincher is known to demand a grueling series of takes to capture a scene perfectly. For instance the Zodiac cast members were required to do upwards of 70 takes for certain scenes much to the displeasure of Jake Gyllenhaal. Rooney Mara had to endure 99 takes for a scene in The Social Network and said that Fincher enjoys challenging people. Gone Girl averaged 50 takes per scene. In one of the episodes for Mindhunter it was reported that a nineminute scene took 11 hours to shoot. When asked about this method Fincher said I hate earnestness in performance... usually by take 17 the earnestness is gone. He added that he wants a scene to be as natural and authentic as possible. Some actors appreciate this approach arguing that the subtle adjustments have a big difference in the way a scene is carried. Others have been critical with R. Lee Ermey stating Fincher wants puppets. He doesnt want actors that are creative.Fincher prefers shooting with Red digital cameras under natural or preexisting light conditions rather than using elaborate lighting setups. Fincher is known to use computergenerated imagery which is mostly unnoticeable to the viewer. He does not normally use handheld cameras during filming instead preferring cameras on a tripod. He said Handheld has a powerful psychological stranglehold. It means something specific and I dont want to cloud whats going on with too much meaning. He has experimented with the disembodied camera movement notably in Panic Room where the camera glides around the house to give the impression of surveillance by an unseen observer.Style and themeseditOne element of Finchers visual style is the specific way in which he uses tilt pan and track in the camera movements. When a character is in motion or expressing emotions the camera moves at the exact same speed and direction as their body. The movements are choreographed precisely between the actors and camera operators. The resulting effect helps the audience connect with the character to understand their feelings. Similarly in his music videos Fincher appreciated that the visuals should enhance the listening experience. He would cut around the vocals and let the choreography finish before cutting the shot. Camera movements are synchronized to the beat of the music.Some regard Fincher as an auteur filmmaker although he dislikes being associated with that term. Much of his work is influenced by classical film noir and neo noir genres. Finchers visual style also includes using monochromatic and desaturated colors of blue green and yellow representing the world that the characters are in. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Fincher uses heavy desaturation for certain scenes and increases or decreases the effect based on the story or characters emotions. Erik Messerschmidt cinematographer for Mindhunter explained the color palette The show has a desaturated greenyellow look... it helps give the show its period feel. He states the effect is achieved through production design costumes and filming locationsnot necessarily through lighting used on set. Fincher also favors detailed and pronounced shadows as well as using minimal light. When asked about his use of dim lighting he said bright lights make the color of skin appear unnatural and that the lights and colors in his films represent the way the world looks to him.Fincher has explored themes of martyrdom alienation and dehumanization of modern culture. In addition to the wider themes of good and evil his characters are usually troubled discontented and flawed they are often unable to socialize and suffer from loneliness. In Seven Zodiac and The Social Network themes of pressure and obsession are explored leading to the characters downfall. Quoting historian Frank Krutnik the writer Piers McCarthy argues that the protagonists of these films are not totally in control of their actions but are subject to darker inner impulses.In a 2017 interview Fincher explained his fascination of sinister themes There was always a house in any neighborhood that I ever lived in that all the kids on the street wondered What are those people up to We sort of attach the sinister to the mundane in order to make things interesting... I think its also because in order for something to be evil it almost has to cloak itself as something else. Fincher once stated I think people are perverts. Ive maintained that. Thats the foundation of my career.CollaboratorseditFrequent Fincher collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus RossOver the course of his career Fincher has shown loyalty to many members of his cast and crew. As a music video director he collaborated with Paula Abdul five times as well as Madonna and Rick Springfield four times each. Once he made the transition to feature films he cast Brad Pitt in three of them. He said of Pitt Onscreen and offscreen Brads the ultimate guy... he has such a great ease with who he is. Bob Stephenson Michael Massee Christopher John Fields John Getz Elias Koteas Zach Grenier Charles Dance Rooney Mara Jared Leto and Richmond Arquette have also appeared in at least two of his films.Fight Club was scored by the Dust Brothers who at that point had never scored a film. Describing their working relationship with Fincher they said he was not hanging over our shoulders telling us what to do and that the only direction he gave was to make the music sound as great as the score from The Graduate 1967. Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the music for The Social Network The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Gone Girl Mank and The Killer. The musicians describe their working relationship as collaborative respectful and inspiring although quipped that it hasnt gotten any easier. Many years before the duo worked with Fincher he arranged for a remix of the Nine Inch Nails song Closer to play over the opening credits of Seven. Howard Shore composed the scores for Seven The Game and Panic Room.Darius Khondji and Jeff Cronenweth have served as cinematographers for Finchers films. Khondji said Fincher deserves a lot of credit. It was his influence that pushed me to experiment and got me as far as I did. Fincher has hired sound designer Ren Klyce in all his films since 1995 and trusts him implicitly. He has worked with film editor Angus Wall since 1988. Wall has worked on seven of his films five of which as editor.Donald Graham Burt has served as a production designer for six films and Bob Wagner has served as an assistant director for six. Casting director Laray Mayfield has worked with Fincher for over 20 years. In a 2010 interview Fincher said You dont have to love all of your cocollaborators but you do have to respect them. And when you do when you realize that people bring stuff to the table thats not necessarily your experience but if you allow yourself to relate to it it can enrich the buffet that youre going to bring with you into the editing room.Personal lifeeditFincher married model Donya Fiorentino sister of actress Linda Fiorentino.

Read ourprivacy noticeDavid Fincher is notorious for his relentless filmmaking style whereby he makes his cast shoot certain scenes for hours and hours until he captures what he set out to achieve. It turns out his work on the first season of Mindhunter was no exception.Despite the fasterpaced schedule of television Fincher and lead star Jonathan Groff  who plays FBI agent Holden Ford  revealed the extent the filmmaker went to ensure the success of a particular scene.Gathered at an FYC event on Friday 1 June Fincher  who directed four episodes  detailed that the scene in question featuring serial killer Jerry Brudos Happy Anderson lasted for a hefty nineandahalf minutes and was shot using three cameras around 75 times.IndieWire reports that while Groff and costar Holt McCallany Bill Tench quickly adapted to Finchers rigorous approach Anderson was more taken aback.RecommendedHow serial killer Ed Kemper helped FBI agents understand other crimesThe scene with Happy Anderson was 11 pages he explained. We had three cameras outside the cage and wed do a nineandahalfminute take. Then Id walk in with a yellow pad filled with singlespaced notes to Groff OK thats a joke you cant toss that off. And this This is a statement. Make sure thats a statement. And Jonathan would be there going okay okay. Then wed do another nineminute take and hed do all that stuff I asked and Id go to Holt and go over four pages of notes with him. And Happy was like What Were really going to do this every timeHe continues We didnt have a break well we broke for lunch  I would say we did it 75 times in the day.Fincher is wellknown for being a perfectionist with reports claiming he was averaging around 50 takes for each scene in films Zodiac and Gone Girl.McCallany waded in stating he didnt mind adding I find when you do something over and over again you discover things. When you guys would say take 14 or take 20 suddenly something becomes apparent to you that you didnt really realise. Its not that we were making huge changes but the subtle adjustments we made or small adjustments David will give you can make a big difference in the way a scene plays out. So Im a fan of doing a lot of takes.27 horror films that will actually terrify you Show all 2712727 horror films that will actually terrify you 27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Orphanage 2007Directed by J.A. Bayona  Both my selections on this list mark the two instances in which Ive actively cried in a cinema out of fear if you can believe thats possible. Though J.A. Bayonas ghostly tale is a beautiful throwback to Gothic conventions which lace its hauntings with powerful emotions and warnings that kid with the sack on its head traumatised me for life. Worse I came back home and remembered the flat Id newly moved in to had a cupboard with no key and no clue as to what may be contained inside considering whats eventually found to be hiding in the basement of The Orphanage  yeah I didnt sleep that night  Clarisse Loughrey27 horror films that will actually terrify you Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956Directed by Don Siegel  Another film that doesnt rely upon or need special effects to make you a bit scared to turn the telly off when youve finished watching it. So disturbing in fact that the studio insisted the ending was changed to make it less dark before it was released. The 1978 remake is very good too  Jon Di Paolo27 horror films that will actually terrify you House of Usher 1960Directed by Roger Corman  Im a huge fan of Roger Cormans House of Usher 1960 the first in a series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations the schlock producer made with the gloriously hammy Vincent Price. The latter stars as Roderick Usher a sickly aristocrat living in queasy isolation with his sister in the crumbling mansion of the title. Cormans Poe films became increasingly formulaic and campy but this one really delivers  Joe Sommerlad27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Exorcist 1973Directed by William Friedkin  There have been countless movies about demonic possession but none of them have managed to be quite as memorable as William Friedkins The Exorcist. This film has received as much critical acclaim as it has attention from terrified audiences decade after decade. Every sequence will offset your internal rhythm while scenes of a disfigured little girl Linda Blairs Regan crawling on the ceiling will haunt you for many nights to come  Zlata Rodionova27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974Directed by Tobe Hooper I am living proof that Tobe Hoopers seminal horror should not be watched at the age of 11 between the horrifying dinner table scene  where the cries of Marilyn Burns Sally are laughed at by her cannibalistic captors  and that final shot of Leatherface Gunnar Hansen flailing his chainsaw about aimlessly in the air The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the horror film I would least like to watch again  Jacob Stolworthy27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Shining 1980Directed by Stalney Kubrick This Stanley Kubrick classic doesnt necessarily fit into the horror box but for audiences chasing a real sense of unease The Shining fits the bill. Based on Stephen Kings novel of the same name the film tells the story of the Torrance family who hole up in an isolated hotel for the closed winter season. Things take a macabre turn as an evil presence begins to influence father Jack Jack Nicholson to undertake a murderous rampage. In typical Kubrick style nothing is as it seems  Megan Townsend27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Watcher in the Woods 1980Directed by John Hough I really enjoy watching horror films even though they never scare me thats not including The Watcher in the Woods of course. Yes  Disney film The Watcher in the Woods. Theres just something inherently unsettling about the films frequent use of mirrors that freaked me out and the way writing and apparitions suddenly appear in them. Who knew a Disney film could give you nightmares for weeks  Richard Williams27 horror films that will actually terrify you Brazil 1985Directed by Terry Gilliam  Every Halloween I consider wearing one of the hideous baby face masks from Brazil and every year I chicken out for fear of my reflection. A sinister Michael Palin is also extremely disorientating. But nothing beats the sinking dread of a tyrannical behemoth bureaucracy swallowing you whole and turning your dreams into nightmares. Having said that Brazil is also my favourite film  Joe VeseyByrne27 horror films that will actually terrify you Candyman 1992Directed by Bernard Rose  I was waaay too young when I first saw Bernard Roses Candyman and it still scares me to this day. Its the story of a PhD student Virginia Madsen who visits an impoverished Chicago tenement building to investigate an urban myth whispered among the residents about a hookhanded ghost stalking the corridors. Naturally she soon realises the phantom is all too real. Philip Glasss delicate music box score is eerie indeed and Tony Todd utterly mesmerising in the lead. Candyman manages to be both sincerely frightening and an important statement about the legacy of slavery and the injustices still endured by Black America as relevant now as it was in 1992. Say his names three times before the mirror I dare you  Joe Sommerlad27 horror films that will actually terrify you Screamers 1995Directed by Christian Duguay Screamers is based on a Philip K Dick story and his trademark otherworldliness and fascination with the dark side of AIhuman nature give it some genuinely chilling twists. Plus theres robots with sharp blades that tear out of the ground and chop you to bits  Jon Di Paolo27 horror films that will actually terrify you Scream 1996Directed by Wes Craven Okay hear me out. Scream might not be a highquality film or achieve anywhere near the art of modern indie horrors being made on a fraction of the budget but its antagonist still haunts me and Ill tell you why zombies dont scare me demons dont scare me ghosts dont scare me but humans do. None of horrors clichd evil beings are as terrifying as a human on a murderous rampage with no apparent motive. Ghostface is gangly awkward fallible and all the scarier for it. The way he runs around like a toddler blindingly slashing at the air is chilling and an unwelcome reminder that if you did die at the hands of a psychopath it wouldnt involve a cinematic wellplaced spike but a floundering struggle  Christopher Hooton Sportsphoto Ltd.Allstar27 horror films that will actually terrify you Funny Games 1997Directed by Michael Haneke Whilst not the first film that comes to mind when considering the horror genre this film for me is as scary as it gets. At first the violence seems irrational and nihilistic but the most terrifying thing about Michael Hanekes Austrian psychological thriller about two men who randomly torture a middleclass family in their idyllic vacation home is the fact that we become the driving force behind the horror. Breaking down the fourth wall spoilers ahead one of the ohsopolite psychopaths rewinds a scene that doesnt go his way and gives us a much more gruesome ending to the film otherwise as he says straight to camera wed all be deprived of our pleasure  Kirsty Major27 horror films that will actually terrify you Ringu 1998Directed by Hideo Nakata  Make no mistake if the Hollywood version of Ring is a decent remake the Japanese original is far more petrifying. There is just something inexplicable about Asian horror films rooted in Japanese folklore and ghost stories that makes them far creepier. Watching it for the very first time is like living a nightmare as Sadako crawls out of the well youll find yourself automatically pushing against the back of the sofa in the hope she will not eventually end up in your living room. The movie put me off watching TV and picking up the phone for a couple of weeks at least  Zlata RodionovaPhotograph AllstarOmega27 horror films that will actually terrify you Mulholland Drive 2001Directed by David Lynch  For me the scariest moment in any movie ever has to be from David Lynchs Mulholland Drive. The scene happens around 10 minutes into the film but is sold bold and confident in its ability to scare you it actually tells you exactly how it is going to do so. By using dream logic distorted sound and strange camera movements the scene transports you into a nightmare turned reality for one of the characters in the scene. These five minutes are exhausting to behold but it is a masterclass in how to effectively use the jump scare. This segment perfectly encapsulates the rest of this beautiful confusing and surreal movie as you never know what lies around the corner on Mulholland Drive  Greg Evans27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Others 2001Directed by Alejandro Amenbar  This chiller doesnt rely on CGI or special effects to be scary  its all about building tension through oldfashioned dramatic tricks and it does it brilliantly. Nicole Kidman delivers an absolute tour de force and it is riveting and affecting as well as liable to make you jump out of your seat  Jon Di Paolo 27 horror films that will actually terrify you Dark Water 2002Directed by Hideo Nakata  One of the horror films that still scares the heck out of me. Its by Hideo Nakata who made the equally as scary The Ring. Hollywood did a remake with Jennifer Connelly in 2005 but there is definitely something about the original Japanese version that leaves you with a haunting feeling  Mars El Brogy27 horror films that will actually terrify you Signs 2002Directed by M. Night Shyamalan  Seeing that alien for the first time as he gets unceremoniously booted from a Brazilian kids birthday party still gets me just as it did when I ran from the room the first time I saw it. I still resent that broadcasters blatant flouting of TV dogma by playing so much tensioninducing build up before the action itself  Charlie Atkin27 horror films that will actually terrify you Paranormal Activity 2009Directed by Oren Peli  The only film Ive ever watched where I considered switching off halfway through out of sheer terror. The tension ratchets up endlessly as the found footage style adds to the claustrophobia. A decision was made long ago never to watch it again  Tom EmburyDennis  Or a cautionary tale for leaving your leg dangling out of your bed. Injecting fresh life into the foundfootage formula the first Paranormal Activity managed to induce chills the world over by the simple  and rather frugal  use of a static camera set up by couple Katie and Micah all in the hope they can learn whats going bump in the night. With every new nighttime scene  each displaying more demonic hauntings than the last  your sounds of terror will become more audible.  Jacob Stolworthy  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you Black Swan 2010Directed by Darren Aronofsky  Guaranteed to make your skin crawl Darren Aronofskys 2010 take on classic ballet Swan Lake is a textbook example of psychological horror. Ballerina Nina Natalie Portman lands the coveted role of the Swan Princess only to find she cannot engage with her evil alterego  the Black Swan. When Nina attempts to engage with her darkside she loses herself altogether  Megan Townsend27 horror films that will actually terrify you VHS 2012Directed by Various  The rising crop of horror filmmakers Adam Wingard and Ti West included teamed up to make VHS an anthology film comprised of six disturbing vignettes if one doesnt scare you senseless its a sure bet the next will. The opening two linger in my memory each taking familiar concepts  a night out with your pals and a honeymoon  and adding a slant of depravity thatll chill you to the core. Next time someone tells you they like you run a mile  Jacob Stolworthy27 horror films that will actually terrify you Oculus 2013Directed by Mike Flanagan  Psychological thrillers can be terrifying enough as they are but throw in a spooky supernatural storyline and youll have nightmares for days or at least I did. Oculus tells the story of a woman determined to clear her brothers name in the brutal murder of their parents. The siblings suspect supernatural forces are at play with an antique mirror being at the root of all the evil. Suffice to say the first thing I did as soon as I got home from the cinema was to throw a blanket over the giant mirror sitting in my room  you know just in case  Chantal DaSilva27 horror films that will actually terrify you It Follows 2014Directed by David Robert Mitchell  David Robert Mitchells synthencrusted nightmare shows sounds essential role in the genre. It Follows premises itself on the very simple idea that something is out there something indistinguishable from your fellow man except that theyre always headed straight for you. No matter where you may be and no matter where you may run to. A figure walking down the street may seem ordinary at first but Disasterpeaces score here turns that image into paralysing fright. Seeing this in the cinema tucked up right next to the loudspeaker as the synths reached their climax and blood pooled the screen unashamedly made me cry like a kid left behind in a shopping mall  Clarisse Loughrey  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you Green Room 2015Directed by Jeremy Saulnier  Patrick Stewart isnt the first name that comes to mind when I think of horror but 2015s Green Room left me terrified suspense from start to finish with an uncharacteristically dark turn from Stewart as detached neoNazi leader Darcy Banker  Ronan OShea  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Invitation 2015Directed by Karyn Kusama  You look great.  Ive started this new class its changed my life. Weve all been there. A dinner party with old friends someone you deliberately havent seen in a while proselytizing about their latest fad diet class or retreat. The Invitation takes that a step further Will takes his new partner for dinner at his exwifes house joining a cast of friends who havent seen each other since he lost his son over a year ago. As the wine flows and two new guests join the old crew Will begins to realise that theyve been brought here for another reason all together  Kirsty Major  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you Under the Shadow 2016Directed by Babak Anvari  For anyone who has seen Under the Shadow it should come as no surprise that Iranianborn Babak Anvaris film is Britains Oscar entry for best Best Foreign Language Film. Though short in length a brief 74 mins every scene drips with intensity. The 80s set film follows a mother and her young daughter as they struggle with a demon haunting their apartments building in wartorn Iran. Alongside the nightmarish torment of the Djinn the building is being bombed by militant forces meaning the threat comes from both inside and out culminating in one of the years best horror films  Jack Shepherd  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Witch 2016Directed by Robert Eggers  The Witch is set in 17th contrary New England and follows a family banished from their Puritan plantation. When the youngest suddenly disappears the blame falls upon Anya TaylorJoys young character though she knows something more is at play. As the film progresses stranger and stranger things start to happen all with a heavy twang of religious imagery. The jump scares may not be frequent but the atmosphere is utterly terrifying  Jack Shepherd27 horror films that will actually terrify you Raw 2017Directed by Julia Ducournau  All good horror reflects our deepest collective fears back at us and Raw gives us this with a side of human flesh. Justine is a firstyear veterinary student who at once fasts and purges lets loose and withdraws scaling the highs and lows that coming of age brings. She throws herself with abandon at human flesh both literally and metaphorically  with an older sister whose destructive behaviour leaves her with little in the way of a role model to help navigate her newly burgeoning desires  Kirsty MajorFincher also went to extreme lengths to ensure Cameron Brittons character Ed Kemper retained the eerie atmosphere required to make him the series highlight.It became really obvious coming out of the first readthrough that Make sure Cameron doesnt talk to anyone. He cant fraternise with anyone. I dont want this to be a social thing. He has to literally come from Pluto and be in the show. He cant be indoctrinated into what anyone else is up to. It has to be that this guy shows up hes got all the time in the world  13 life sentences  and hes going to tell you what you want to know.

Some actors have clearly gelled with the filmmaker working with him more than once Brad Pitt Rooney Mara while others found the process exhausting and creatively unrewarding Jake Gyllehaal. All this is to say that on Finchers currently in production Gone Girl its a not shock to learn that once again hes doing everything he can to get the most he can out of a scene. The Southeast Missourian recently chronicled an afternoon of shooting inCape Girardeau an extrasfilled sequencethat the paper noted found Fincher filming over and over again for several hours. The scene featured over one hundred people acting as media and regular citizens chasing down a police car with someone of interest inside. Approximately 20 takes were done of this scene which according to Finchers longtime producerCean Chaffin is on the low end for this film.Related Stories Rooney Mara Now Chooses Directors Carefully After Some Bad Experiences  and a Good One with David Fincher Holt McCallany Anchors True Wrestling Family Drama The Iron Claw She told the paper Fincher is averaging about 50 takes per scene in Gone Girl a figure markedly up from 27per scene in previous movies.  its an odd business. A lot of times its more like doing construction than painting a picture she said.So why does Fincher insist on this methodI hate earnestness in performance usually by Take 17 the earnestness is gone he toldThe New York Timesin 2007. And when we spoke to the director in 2010 he shared what he told Justin Timberlake before the singeractor signed up for The Social Network which goes a long way in explaining Finchers process. Were going to microfractally explore this text cause all there is in this movie is people talking. Were going to pick that shit out of pepper. Were going to find the moments between the moments that move and resonate. And if youre not willing to hit that hole a lot of times dont do this. Because its going to be agony for you. If the charge for you is wardrobe malfunction youre not going to get that. Theres not going to be a lot surprises here youre going to surprise yourself. Im going to have you do it until you have gone past memorizing it gone past knowing your own name until we can get all of the the physical nonsense so ingrained that we can get to what the actual text is.In short Fincher wants the words to feel natural real and lived in almost like a reflex and thus they will leap off the page more authentically.

Some actors have clearly gelled with the filmmaker working with him more than once Brad Pitt Rooney Mara while others found the process exhausting and creatively unrewarding Jake Gyllehaal. All this is to say that on Finchers currently in production Gone Girl its a not shock to learn that once again hes doing everything he can to get the most he can out of a scene.The Southeast Missourian recently chronicled an afternoon of shooting inCape Girardeau an extrasfilled sequencethat the paper noted found Fincher filming over and over again for several hours. The scene featured over one hundred people acting as media and regular citizens chasing down a police car with someone of interest inside. Approximately 20 takes were done of this scene which according to Finchers longtime producerCean Chaffin is on the low end for this film. She told the paper Fincher is averaging about 50 takes per scene in Gone Girl a figure markedly up from 27per scene in previous movies.  its an odd business. A lot of times its more like doing construction than painting a picture she said.So why does Fincher insist on this methodI hate earnestness in performance usually by Take 17 the earnestness is gone he toldThe New York Timesin 2007. And when we spoke to the director in 2010 he shared what he told Justin Timberlake before the singeractor signed up for The Social Network which goes a long way in explaining Finchers process.Were going to microfractally explore this text cause all there is in this movie is people talking.

The first two episodes of that landmark series saw one of American cinemas most fastidious craftsmen make his first foray into television. NowDavid Fincher is back and doubling down helming four episodes of 2017s most anticipated bingefest an adaptation of the memoir by FBI agent John Douglas the criminal profiler who served as inspiration for Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris bestseller The Silence of the Lambs. Fincher gaveus a call for an epic conversation about all things MINDHUNTER.LWLies Was MINDHUNTER a project you developed yourselfFincher Yeah. Lets see Charlize Theron called me around 20092010. It was definitely before House of Cards. She owned the book and had the idea to develop it as a TV show so we started talking about what it could be. Id never done TV. I was like I dont know enough about it. We developed it together with a writer that she had sort of already hired. I was only kind of tangentially involved I wasnt in the drivers seat and more of the mind that if something can come of this Ill certainly direct the pilot.We went down a road where I met with the writer Joe Penhall and laid out the things that Im not interested in the most important one being the notion that a fine line separates the FBI agent from the serial killer. I felt that it was well trawled I felt that it was a literary conceit and really had nothing to do with why I think people are interested in serial killers. I dont think people are interested in serial killers because theyre so much like them I think theyre interested in the aberrant because its so hard to understand. I really felt that this was an opportunity to reclaim not the genre because I hate the idea that serial killer films are a genre but more the idea that the serial killer is some kind of Wile E Coyote super genius.What else were you keen to avoidI laid out that I wasnt interested in the minute differences between the hunter and the hunted and Im not interested in an AB storyline. Im not interested in Heres what Batmans up to and heres what the Jokers up to. I wanted to talk about the late 1970s postCivil Rights postsexual revolution postWatergate and postSon of Sam where the FBI has to brace its boots and try to reinvigorate itself in order to become relevant again. They were at a particular lull where theyd been responsible for the house of the SLA burning down they were in a valley in terms of their public relations. I felt that that was a really interesting time.At what point did you decide to make it about this fictional character Holden Ford removing John Douglas from the narrativeThat was Joe Penhall.Once wed decided that we werent going to use the first script written by the first writer Charlize suggested Joe. Hed written The Road and she really loved working with him. We pitched him what we were thinking and he went away and came back with what was the real epiphany which was that we cant do it with Ressler and Douglas. We need to be able to separate these characters where we need to separate them. Were not only talking about a time and a place we had to be able to apportion the characters certain behavioural traits that we needed to dramatise the story that we wanted to tell. Joes solution and I think it was the right one was that we needed to fictionalise. We cant get into or deal with who really did what. Were gonna stay with the people who were interviewed and were gonna talk about and dramatise those interviews but Joe was the one who said I cant be beholden to this book. I need to be able to move to draw the best drama and not be worried about who would get credit for what.There are a lot of ideas that need to be transmitted to the audience in terms of what the lead character is trying to do so that when the first serial killer interview with Ed Kemper comes theyre effectively asking the same questions of him as the FBI agent. You once said The first rule of cinema is that a movie has to teach an audience how to watch it.I sent it to a friend of mine whos a stonecold genius just this great screenwriter. I showed him the first two episodes and his comment was really interesting. He said Youve done the exact opposite of television where your character is always the perfect person to solve the dilemma of the show. They may have a problem with alcohol or may have lost a loved one but theyre always the perfect person to wrestle with the problem that the show is going to posit. He said what weve done here is taken somebody whos in some existential malaise  which is something that Joe and I talked about a lot  and its the most difficult thing to dramatise someone who doesnt feel like hes accomplishing what it is he needs to accomplish.Joe did some really interesting thinking about how we introduce a character and introduce his naivete. I mean John Douglas is not a naive guy Holden is a much more naive character. But through this naivete we get to experience how Quantico works and what they wanted from him and how they expected him to behave how they didnt consider themselves to be outmoded and outside the vanguard as it relates to criminology. So we got to experience a lot of that stuff in the first hour. Thats not to say thats the only way to tell a story but we were looking to do a bit more of a hybrid between a movie and a TV show.What does that look like to your mindI dont know that the golden age of television is really television as we know it. Its something thats grown out of certain expectations blurring and subverting a lot of those expectations in surprising ways and I really do feel that whats interesting about the Netflix model  that they dont have to worry about capturing an audience on a given night that they dont have to worry about cliffhangers  is that the way people experience it is much more like literature. You can set the remote down like youd set the book down on your bedside table. It has a different relationship to its audience. The movie business has become about the urgency of Friday to Monday and network television has become about From the makers of using the hit show as the introduction to the new show. Then theres Netflix which is about Look when you get around to it well be here. Its a different problem it requires different things of the audiences time. Ultimately I think it requires a different kind of television.Holden uses these interviews as a means to an end as the toolsto unlockthe criminal mindI think its later that that becomes the case.What he sees is the value of these conversations in illuminating Look the FBI was established to chase Baby Face Nelson from one state into another. Thats how it came to be. It was a never about sitting with them and asking Why did you want to become a bank robber In the Depression no one really cared what the reasons were behind someones impetus. It was pretty fickle it was monetary gain. It was a case of I dont have whats in this bank but I have a tommy gun and Im gonna take whats not rightfully mine. There was a pretty clear cut motive.Do you think he knows where all this is headingI dont even think he knows what hes touched upon that theres something to this idea of the unconscious or the subconscious speaking through these rash explosive compulsive acts of violence. There was something to the things that Edmund Kemper was doing that only he knew and ultimately that was the attraction for me the notion that a monolithic bureaucracy could only inform itself through having some kind of empathy for people who should be beneath our contempt. That in order to have a conversation with someone who is so unlike you that you cant even imagine it and who has things that are driving them that you cant even fathom you have to have compassion even for your enemy to understand why they hate you and why they do what they do.I thought that was interesting. I dont think Id ever seen that. That was one of the hallmarks of Douglas project. He was very good at testing and sparring with these people but he was also very good at engaging them and pulling them out so we could have a better understanding. What they do is inhuman but they are human. He offered an empathetic vacuum a place where you dont judge them you simply listen to them. That was not a J Edgar Hoover idea that was very much sparked by having to change. When David Berkowitz was hunting every night through the boroughs of Manhattan it was something about these people and these circumstances and this location that spoke to him and thats when he pulled the trigger. For whatever reason they couldnt get the manacles on him for a year and he held this entire city in terrified thrall. It was an interesting thing this idea of a guy in a Mormon suit sitting down to talk to someone whos entirely unlike him. It was a pivot. It was a change in the bureau it was a change in criminology and a change in the way that people talked about aberrant behaviour.Youve spoken in the past about not liking to be seen to have a style of your own yet youve directed the first two episodes of MINDHUNTER which would presumably look different if say Asif Kapadia had directed them. Do the requirements of uniformity throughout the series mean that other directors will have to do a Fincher moving forwardsI hope not. Nothing makes a filmmaker more selfconscious than watching another filmmaker doing an interpretation of what youve done. The director of photography was fairly well versed in what the style was. The style is really just lets not be afraid of conversations. Its My Dinner with Andr the Giant. Theres a sequence with Jerry Brudos that Andrew Douglas did thats just a stainless steel picnic table inside a chainlink cage inside a maximum security concrete bunker that has razor wire over all the windows. The guy comes in and its a conversation about cigarettes whether they can unmanacle him whether he can fix the guys tape recorder. I know that there are filmmakers who if you presented them with a long scene of two guys over a picnic table would go Oh my god where do you go with thisWhen youre approaching a scene thats11 pages of dialogue is that all shot and cut in your head firstYoure always shooting coverage because coverage just means Look you can either embrace coverage like an interior housepainter as in I just need to get as many coats as I can but starting wide there are practical implications to taking two cameras and shooting as wide as you can as a lot of the time you can learn from them. A few takes and a master can just be a case of I gotta have a master or it can be So later when I get into this are you intending to move here Its plastic. You dont want to become a Disneyland animatronic you want to leave room for inspiration. We did not storyboard but if you say that youre a director I dont want you to become reliant on closeups.I want to see the physicality. I want to see the shoulders of this character. I like the worn nature of what these guys wear. How they walk when their gait can only be two feet. What does that do to you How bodies express. The slouch of somebody who has all the time in the world and the erect spine of the guy whos trying to glean something from them and how the FBI agent plays with his tie or rolls his eyes and is already packing his stuff to leave All that stuff goes into it and a lot of television is Get that Tony Scott closeup. We talked about all that stuff.Youre quite vocal about your loathing of the term auteur so much so that you basically gave it to Ed Kempers serial killer as a means of describing his oeuvre.My distaste for the term was exactly the intention. Like what the fuck What is he talking about The problem with auteurism is that it presupposes that one person can impress upon 95 people so clearly that the manifestation of whatever it is going on in your head can be clearly attributed to them. The reality of moviemaking is yknow its a rat fuck. Every day is a skirmish and you might escape every skirmish but there are injuries and there losses and there are things that you had10 meetings about that go off perfectly and there are things that youve had no meetings about that ended up taking eight of the 12 hours in the day because you didnt think it was going to be so complicated.	Shooting television is hard. You do a lot of weeping but its also invigorating.            So the notion that someone calls this perfect idealised version of the scene Its like the jetpropulsion industry the idea that something is windtunnel tested and is gonna go off the way its supposed to  it never goes off the way its supposed to. My issue with auteurism is how do you attribute a master plan to a happy accident There are certain things that you can count on. You have to work at it and you have to know what it is youre trying to do and impart that to an army of people who all have their own ideas about whats important.Everybody who comes on to a set looks at it from a slightly different standpoint. You cant say to the third violinist This is what the totality of the thing should sound like. You just need them to get them to do their thing. When you hear it it either moves you or it doesnt so you have to figure if it needs a little bit more of this or that. Thats happening in the rehearsal its happening in the coverage throughout the day. You hone in as you get tighter and tighter and tighter on people but youre also getting tighter in terms of time. Youre honing in on one little thing and then you do the same again in the edit with the sound effects with the music with the colour grading. Suddenly all this stuff comes together and the notion that anyone could say This is precisely what its going to look like to me is amazing.But there is a directorial perspective a subjectivity that is distinctively yours. That isnt perhaps as distant as Stanley Kubrick or as immersive as Steven Spielberg but thats definitely identifiable and consistent.And thats a decision. I love both those filmmakers. I like dispassion because I like what it does to the audience I like to see things as wide as I possibly can. I dont want to be in the middle of every transaction. Spielbergs staging in a lot of ways is about putting you in harms way. Jaws and Close Encounters are two of my favourite movies. But I look at the stories Im interested in telling or I look at the stories that I have been interested in telling and I sort of go Theres no place for that here. You pick and choose. The important thing is to know what you intend to impart. It comes from the aesthetic. There are things that you hold dear aesthetically there are things that you hold dear behaviourally there are ways that a scene unfolds that feel realistic to you. If youre responsible for how its all going to come off and for how its all going to come together theres no way that you cant inform that. The notion that someone is going to direct a film and not reveal what it is they like about cinema or how they prefer things to be revealed to them or the audience its impossible. Youre doomed to find your worth.I recently spoke toSteven Soderberghabout staging and the implications of film grammar and he brought up you and Spielberg describing you as savants. Do you think thats a fair assessmentYknow its trial and error. Anyone who does this job has to work at it. When you look at the minimalism of Logan Lucky you could mistake it for the Coen brothers in terms of its wide angle wit. Its diabolically complicated. It isnoteasy to do that. Even that bit in the trailer when Channing Tatums been fired and he throws his hard hard and the guy in the foreground is like What just happened Its just stunning. Its not easy shit to do.What are the practical differencesbetween film andTV Do you have the luxury of rehearsalNo youve got a show to put on. Its Mickey RooneyJudy Garland I have to put on a showThats the pressure of it. Its also kind of the beauty of it. Its a circus. Heres the company and the script is as good as it can be by Tuesday because thats the day those nine pages are gonna get shot.So no 99 takesIve only shot 99 takes a couple of times When you have six months to prep something thats going to end up being two hours long on which youve spent a year figuring out the tech and another six months getting everyone prepared for it You can tell people why all these moments link and why youre expecting XYZ so there are much fewer surprises. There are more surprises in television. You have to finish 10 hours of material in the same time you would normally shoot your film not edit just the shooting part. You dont get to vivisection it in the same way. Actors playing roles are constantly revealing new strengths to you and weaknesses. Its hard. But one of the lovely things about working in television is that youre meeting all these actors that may have done a lot or a little and you have to rapidly interface with people youve never met.Is workingin that way liberatingYou do a lot of weeping but its also invigorating.I know that with more prep and with more preproduction meetings I can get people to understand what my intentions are. Often with a television show you get one conversation in the hallway by the coffee machine. You may not get an idea exactly where you want it but youre able to move it over to another scene and itll still be part and parcel of the tapestry you just cant get it specific. It wasnt what you intended.

Please read our Legal Terms  PoliciesAAAEmailThere was a time when David Finchers career threatened to derail. Following his 2002 homeinvasion thriller Panic Room he dropped out of skateboard film Lords of Dogtown and Tom Cruise vehicle Mission Impossible III. He toyed with numerous other projects  including an adaptation of Arthur C Clarkes Rendezvous With Rama  but nothing came to fruition. Making movies is hard he shrugs. It takes a long time. Already known for his Kubricklike fastidiousness Fincher seemed afraid to commit to anything less than the perfect project.Still Fincher knows more than most that patience is a virtue. Arriving just 18 months after Zodiac his meticulous 2007 truelife serialkiller tale that finally returned him to directing comes The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. A nighon threehour epic meditation on life death and all the bits in between and all of a sudden Fincher is looking prolific. I know he grins when we meet in Berlin. And I have nothing new to sayYet with Benjamin Button marking a significant new chapter in his career this couldnt be further from the truth. No longer the punk provocateur Fincher has grown up with a film about growing young.The film has already grossed more than 100m in the USbecoming Finchers most commercially successful film to date eclipsing his previous personal best set by 1995s Se7en. Better still this sensually made adaptation of F Scott Fitzgeralds short story about a man who is born old and ages backwards has been embraced by the industry. It leads the pack at this years Oscars with 13 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director a prize Fincher is also up for at next Sundays Baftas  the first time hes even been nominated for either award.Having lost out at the Golden Globes when Benjamin Button didnt score with one of its five nominations Fincher seems unmoved by such backslapping. Its a great thing to make movies he says. Awards are just icing on the cake. Perhaps hes all too aware of just how fickle Hollywood is. So hellish was his time battling with executives on his 1992 debut Alien 3 he famously stated that hed rather get colon cancer than make another studio movie. Then there was the critical roasting he got over 1999s Fight Club his nihilistic examination of millennial angst the late Evening Standard critic Alexander Walker claimed it was antiGod.This time its hardcore Fincher fans who might feel outraged as the director goes touchyfeely. Beginning at the end of the First World War its a whimsical slice of magic realism as its protagonist played by Brad Pitt is born with the body of an octogenarian and grows younger by the day.Though technically groundbreaking with Pitts facial features grafted on to a body double in these early scenes its a far cry from the grim aesthetic and grisly themes of Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac. Fincher remains unapologetic I dont mind an experience thats emotional if it sneaks up on you. I just dont like it when it announces itself when you see it coming from the first act.The script landed on Finchers desk as far back as 1992 and unlike all the others that have fallen by the wayside it was one he couldnt let go. I read it and it made me cry. I recognised so many of the people in the movie I thought It would be nice to make this movie. Nice This coming from the man who put Gwyneth Paltrows head in a box in Se7en brutalised Jared Letos face in Fight Club and terrorised Jodie Foster in Panic Room Detractors are already sharpening their knives the BBCs Mark Kermode recently sniffing that the film was Forrest Gump with Alevels a reference to the fact that it was cowritten by Gump scribe Eric Roth.Yet this fails to take into account the profoundly tragic dimension of Benjamins dilemma as he falls for Daisy Cate Blanchett a young ballerina he meets when hes a wizened old man. Eventually as he ages backwards and she forwards they pass each other in years and fall under each others spell. Would you still love me if I were old and saggy she asks. Would you still love me if I were young and had acne he replies. Still their problems are much more than cosmetic as the ageing Daisy must contend with a lover approaching adolescence in reverse. As Fincher puts it There isnt a happily ever after.Now 46 his hair and goatee a delicate shade of grey Fincher admits that notions of mortality were swirling through his mind when he first read Roths script. He was reminded of his father Jack Fincher a former Life magazine reporter who died five years ago. I remember the experience of being there when he breathed his last breath he says. It was incredibly profound. When you lose someone who helped form you in lots of ways who is your true north you lose the barometer of your life. Youre no longer trying to please someone or youre no longer reacting against something. In many ways youre truly alone.Not that he is entirely. Hes now with CeChaffin who has produced every film hes made since his 1997 sophomore effort The Game. He also has one 14yearold daughter Phelix Imogen from his fiveyear marriage to model Donya Fiorentino which ended in 1995. Born in Denver Colorado Fincher was raised in California and moved to Oregon in his teens by which point he was already showing signs of his huge talent. In highschool he was producing a local television news show. By 19 he had a job working for George Lucass company Industrial Light and Magic helping create visual effects for 1983s Star Wars episode Return of the Jedi.If that sounds commercial his early work in music videos and ad spots was just as mainstream. Nike and Pepsi Madonna and Michael Jackson all got the Fincher treatment. He helped form promo outfit Propaganda Films a breeding ground for a certain type of brashandflash director. In 1998 the nowdefunct Premiere magazine ran a shot of Fincher with fellow Propaganda employees asking Do these men represent the future of Hollywood filmmaking  or the death of it Pictured with Simon West Tomb Raider Dominic Sena Gone in Sixty Seconds and Michael Bay Pearl Harbor Fincher looked guilty by association.Today dressed in a grey striped shirt and greyandblack check jacket looking more accountant than auteur Fincher is no longer the cocky promo director  if he ever was. Quietly spoken and highly articulate he may come across as rather cold in person but theres something mischievous about him. Its fun to be that misunderstood he says.While Fincher is next planning a biopic of Al Capones nemesis Eliot Ness which will no doubt make the fans breathe easier he claims Benjamin Button is perfectly in keeping with the pattern of his career. I look forward to doing things I havent done before. Im contrary by nature. As soon as somebody tells me it cant be done Im like Why do you say thatEven after the success of Benjamin Button he retains a healthy disrespect for the industry. The opening weekend has never been of interest to me he says. Yes its very satisfying to have movies that open to giant boxoffice numbers in the dickmeasuring contest that is Hollywood. Its a nice thing that you know that this movie is going to be an enormous profit machine. But look at Wizard of Oz  that tanked when it opened and its worth a billion dollars. Citizen Kane almost didnt open due to the influential William Randolph Hearsts dislike of the subject matter. Im not saying my movies are on that classic level but hopefully thats what youre trying to do. Still if it sweeps the Oscars next month its place in cinema history is assured.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 12A opens on FridayTopsy turvy More stories in which time runs backwardsI Havent Dreamed of Flying For a While 2008Mutsuko is 67 when businessman Taura meets her.

David Finchers Misdirections The Movies Inside His Movies   SearchSearchSearchMenuSearchFeaturesThe TriangleThe Hollywood ProspectusContributorsPodcastsVideoQuarterlyESPN.comDavid Finchers Misdirections The Movies Inside His MoviesBen BuysseMoviesOctober 3 2014by Sean Fennessey and Chris Ryan FacebookTwitterPrintInside every David Fincher work there are dozens of little dalliances  illicit affairs taking place just out of plain sight. The elevator pitches are tight  aging backward founding Facebook Zodiac killer Swedish banking crime seven deadly sins dont talk about Fight Club  and most of them will leave you wanting to jump right back down that elevator shaft. But look closely and you will find the wonderful movements that make up Finchers various filmmaking symphonies  the buddy comedy insideZodiac the musical insideThe Curious Case of Benjamin Button the campus comedy insideThe Social Network the slapstick farce insidePanic Room.This all began after Fight Club his scathing satire marketed as a bro bible. Or maybe it was a bro bible marketed as a satire. Maybe it started because Fincher never wanted his audiences to be confused again but also didnt want to sacrifice the little joys of filmmaking. So he began hiding those joys.Fincher is renowned for his sumptuous compositions his superhuman eye for detail and his reputation for putting actors through endless rigorous takes to strip them of earnestness and capture exactly the performance he seeks hisfilms can at first glance seem almost didactic joyless and severe. This is after all the man who sees Star Wars as the story of two slaves.Fincher has a reputation for being uncompromising. He doesnt sound  fun. Josh Brolin talks about working with Paul Thomas Anderson as being absolute fucking chaos Quentin Tarantino writes tailormade parts for his loyal company of actors and leads them in cheers on the set Steven Soderbergh a longtime Fincher pal awakens the DIY spirit in his colleagues by working fast cheap and in control. But Fincher Fincher will break you.Heres the problem with that narrative It shortsells just how playful he can be.With the release of his 10th feature Gone Girl we look at the ideas hidden inside the work David Fincher has made since the turn of the millennium.The Slapstick Farce InsidePanic RoomIn the aftermath of Finchers twin triumphs Se7en and Fight Club Panic Room is like a riddle that a troll living under a bridge might ask you Where is it safe but dangerous full of love and surrounded by hate confined but allseeing In Jodie Fosters thiefproof steel cage where this veiled feminist barn burner plays is where. Think of the boxes men put women in the way men simultaneously shield women from and threaten them with violence  thats one way to look at this movie. Theres all kinds of weightiness to be drawn out of David Koepps script which is an elaborate Hitchcock update  all highconcept execution and thin characterization. But letting Fincher and his roving camera slink in and out of rooms around the bannisters of a stairwell up and down a service elevator makes for a technically miraculous achievement. And he has fun as his camera leers at a cell phone just out of reach under a bed or tracks a swirling whirlwind of paper blowing in the night wind. There are greater visual crescendos in his filmography but few accomplished in such confined space. Its a fun movie but rarely considered an important one. Minor Fincher.Panic Room arrived with a great anticipation it could never live up to but what it really signals is Finchers entreaty to the confines of the commercial. Finchers movies to this point were devilish entertainments but they were no doubt twisted. Koepp  who also wrote Jurassic Park and Mission Impossible  understands how to please audiences. Together they made something that is a half of their wholes. Panic Room is gripping grim and strange at times but it has a little pep in its perps. Theres nothing funny about home invasion kidnapping and murder so this thriller with Swisswatch plotting should not be the source of so much glee. And yet The SequenceFincher has taken great joy in destroying Jared Letos beautiful visage. Three years before Panic Room he had Fight Clubs Ed Norton turn Jordan Catalanos high cheekbones into decanned Alpo. For a period Fincher liked to make Leto  heretofore glassyeyed disaffected and impeccable  into a squirming bratty pissant. Here Leto plays Junior a rich crook out to rob his family of the inheritance they would otherwise split. Its Juniors plan to break into the new home of Meg Altman Foster where his deceased fathers fortune resides. Fincher immediately communicates that Junior is a twit. Big mouth cornrows and the What me whine of a fortunate son. He gets his comeuppance and in perfectly Three Stoogesian fashion.Watch how Leto modulates his performance all big eyes and exaggerated gestures.Its like a series of Mel Brooks sight gags shot by Michael Bay.Just as Leto overplays the comedy the drama ratchets up. Listen to the spare but booming score of this sequence. Its lifeordeath as Fosters character ignites the propane being funneled into the panic room. And thenLetos reaction after literally turning a blue streak is like Lou Costello meeting the Wolfman. Is Leto going too far This isnt a choice he made alone. Even David Fincher knows how funny it is watching Jared Leto burn. How many takes do you think this tookThe Buddy Comedy InsideZodiacThe cruelest image in Zodiac  and remember this is a movie where a long static shot captures a picnicking couple being stabbed while tied up  is the timelapse shot of San Franciscos Transamerica Pyramidbeing erected set to the sounds of Marvin Gayes Inner City Blues.Its actually a kind of cruel joke1 The world moves on buildings  monuments to mans ingenuity  go up even while everything around you falls apart. The world does not care whether you caught the man in black.Paramount was hoping for Se7en and Fincher came up with his newspaper movie. The studio more or less dumped it giving it no awards push After all these are the guys who were working Nacho Libre. Fincher which is a shame because its probably one of the five best films of the last 15 years. As a neonoir Zodiac has only Chinatown for competition. This is a movie about the destructive powers of obsession about needing to know the unknowable and the corrosive power of time. Instead of Grail Knights Fincher has detectives and journalists and he puts them on a quest that leads to nowhere.Its also a great buddycop movie.Zodiac is rightfully celebrated for its attention to period detail its recreation of the bureaucratic nightmare that is the modern criminal justice system and is notorious for the toll it took on its actors. The film was shot on digital with endless takes and little need to break in between. This prompted Robert Downey Jr. to leave jars of urine around the setas an act of protest. Stay strong brother. He would later say of Finchers working style I just decided aside from several times I wanted to garrote him that I was going to give him what he wanted. I think Im a perfect person to work for him because I understand gulags. Jake Gyllenhaal is still trying to put himself back together after playing codebreaking cartoonist Robert Graysmith.Whatever trials the cast went through to make the film must have bonded them together. Few Fincher movies are about people hitting it off  if anything vulnerability and connection are weaknesses in his universe. Just ask Morgan Freeman. Zodiac doesnt exactly have a warm gooey center. But it does understand friendship and how it can be both baptized and broken by labor. Maybe all that time in the gulag was worth it.The SequenceBy the time Downeys Paul Avery invites Graysmith to a local bar Mortis there have already been several grisly murders a couple of terrifying letters and a possible appearance by a serial killer on a televised callin show. I think everyone could use a drink.What follows is one of the more charismatic exchanges in Fincherland. The domineering Avery interrogating Graysmith Avery What do you do for funGraysmith I love to read. I enjoy books.Avery Those are the same things.This scene is basically shot in the dark and features two men both on the way to being shitfaced  one eventually doing bumps in a booth  talking about the cryptographic curiosities of a murderer. And its the brightest moment in the film  a portrait of connection of two like minds coming together despite their constitutional differences.There are two pairs in the center of Zodiac the San Francisco Chronicle duo of Graysmith and Avery and the police detectives Dave Toschi and Bill Armstrong played by Mark Ruffalo and Anthony Edwards. The former pair is an uneasy alliance forged by a night of drinking Aqua Velvas  and bonded through a shared obsession with discovering the Zodiacs identity. The latter are friends the way only people who spend most of their waking hours together working can be They are more like a married couple finishing one anothers sentences and providing muchneeded boxes of animal crackers when necessary.Of course everything ends and thats how you find yourself on a houseboat that doubles as a gin mill and triples as a pharmacy. Avery winds up on just such a boat  and Armstrong leaves Toschi opting to see his kids grow up rather than chase shadows. I suppose the tragedy at the heart of Zodiac is that all of this work went in and they never caught the real killer. But what happened to those who chased that killer and their friendships always seemed far sadder.The Technicolor Musical InsideThe Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonThe odd duck. Thats the best way to describe Finchers elongation of the F. Scott Fitzgerald story about a man who ages backward. It is a long languorous ultimately soporific lunge for grace. It has no urgency no verve no edge. But for all of this movies problems  and they are myriad from Brad Pitts casting to the dubious resemblance the script bears to Forrest Gump2  there are still traces of fun.Against the washedout taupe beige and coffeecolored palette that Fincher uses to animate 1920s Louisiana he splashes accents. Theyre little grace notes indications of a heart beating inside a corpse. Look at thisFincher zeroes in on Pitts entrancing blue irises drapes Taraji P. Henson in a garish pink coat and fetishizes Cate Blanchetts luminous imperial red hair. He looks hard for the little lights. Theyre like desperate acts of rebellion in an otherwise conforming exercise. The movie says Ill take that Oscar but these rogue shades say Sex desire weirdness  goddamnit let me out of this prestigemovie coffinThe SequenceIn the movies most elegant sequence a reunited Benjamin and Daisy Blanchett find themselves in a courtyard at dusk. And for a brief spell lust takes over. Daisy a dancer seduces Benjamin with a series of balletic movements her body a pencil and then a compass limbs lifting up and down.It lasts only two minutes and when it does end Daisy goes in for the kill. If this were a Vincente Minnelli musical from the 1950s like The Band Wagon or Brigadoon its at this moment a frantic jazz number would break out and Pitt would begin singing some veiled sexual innuendo about feeling fresh. Fincher  the man who taught Madonna to vogue who went straight up with Paula Abdul who let Christy Turlington vamp  inched right up to the face of his first fullblown musical. And then he pulled back.The Campus Comedy InsideThe Social NetworkLife moves pretty fast in this movie and if you dont stop and look around once in a while you could miss something. The Social Network is told by unreliable narrators speaking at a series of overlapping lawsuit depositions in the dense languages of legalese and tech jargon. The villain of the story is played at one point or another by almost all of its heroes and midway through the film the role of protagonist actually switches from Jesse Eisenbergs Mark Zuckerberg to Andrew Garfields Eduardo Saverin. Its no longer a story about the defendant its a story about the plaintiff.In retrospect all this sleight of hand was probably confusing for viewers. Fincher didnt provide a users manual and that left the film up to a variety of interpretations. The Social Network was criticized upon its release for the creative liberties it took in its rendering of recent history. Much of this criticism was laid at the feet ofAaron Sorkin who penned the semiautomatic dialogue. Sorkin would go on to straight up treat history like a prop with The Newsroom so its no surprise he allegedly played fast and loose with some characterizations placing a disproportionate amount of importance on power old money tradition and the anxiety of acceptance. Sorkins fictional Harvard features moments possibly fashioned out of whole cloth painting what some have described as an inaccurate and unfair portrait of Zuckerberg and his motivations. To say nothing of his girlfriends.For instance this scene apparently did not happenSo let me ask you a question Do you care whether Bob Woodward really asked Carl Bernstein if there was anywhere he didnt smoke Would you rather live in the world where The Social Network was a letterperfect piece of documentary history or the one where you get to see Andrew Garfield tell Jesse Eisenberg to Lawyer up assholeFour years later this is a nobrainer and the movie is still the most purely entertaining one Fincher has ever made. Theres an understandable urge to make popular culture answer for all sorts of crimes and misdemeanors and to want the artifacts of our culture to mean something more than simply what they are. Certainly we are all little Daniel Kaffees staring at the screen begging for the truth. But sometimes Jaws is just about a shark. That should be enough. Welltold stories are a wonder and The Social Network is one of the besttold of the decade.Part of whats wonderful about the film is its energy. This feels like Finchers youngest film. He didnt just catch a cast on its way up he was the trampoline that bounced them into the constellation. If you were a young actor in The Social Network youd almost be pissed off. What are the chances you are ever going to be in a movie as good as this againThe young ones are crucial here though. The Social Network has been described as a story about ambition greed and the Information Age. Thats not cool. You know whats cool COLLLLLLLEGE.The SequenceWhen Mark Zuckerberg pitches the idea for The Facebook to Eduardo Saverin in the freezing Cambridge cold outside of a Jewish fraternitys Jamaicanthemed party he says What if we took the entire social experience of college and put it onlineIn the spirit of people stealing ideas Fincher goes ahead and takes a fivefinger discount on this one He puts the entire social experience of college into a sevenminute film sequence.A little less than 10 minutes into the film the newly single slightly buzzed Zuckerberg gets an idea from a drunk friend in his dorm room and lets the hacking begin. Just like that the world was going up on a Tuesday.You probably didnt go to Harvard and wherever you did wind up going to school probably wasnt lit by Fincher and Jeff Cronenweth so it didnt look like you were living inside J.M.W. Turners Fishermen at Sea. But you probably did have nights like the one in which Zuckerberg and his few friends hacked the Harvard network and came up with the germ of the idea that would eventually become Facebook. Of course you came up with a toxic pizza topping combo those dudes changed the world.The Atticus Ross and Trent Reznor composition that scores the sequence is called In Motion and thats the thing to keep in mind Something is always moving in this scene  if its not Finchers camera its Zuckerbergs fingers the clock or the cursor on his computer screen as he simultaneously blogs and codes. This is college  simultaneously sedentary and thrilling.Meanwhile in a different part of town on a different planet this is happeningThis sequence is shot scored and performed like a heist. But watch the various kids  Dustin and Billy making screwdrivers the stoned dude on the couch watching Shark Week the students in the lab Erica Albrights roommate in her flannel pajamas the kids in the pizza parlor all while beautiful people on E dance to Seratosynced songs.Watch the subtle ways in which Saverin and Zuckerberg interact. Not yet business partners not yet courtroom opponents  just two guys with a very specific dynamic.This is Finchers campus tale  somewhere in here is his version of Lucky Jim or a David Lodge novel  set inside his American dream story. Outsiders looking in through a computer screen. We as viewers in turn looking in on the outsiders through their windows. And whats that written on one of themAbout those windows. Whether you went to Harvard or Temple or lived on an organic farming collective your late teens and early twenties are a time of dislocation alienation and scattered moments of ecstasy and occasionally Ecstasy. Which is weird because its also a time when you are living all over other people. Fincher gets at the highdensity alienation that comes along with college  all the lonely people where do they all belong Dorms probably. Who can say whether the footage of the bacchanalian finalclub party isnt the collective fever dream of all the kids in hooded sweatshirts shut out of the imagined gathering they didnt get invited toThe essence of the films take on Facebook is right here This was a way to see through those windows over those walls to create your own finalclub. But to show this Fincher had to ever so briefly seven minutes show the loneliness and the fun these guys were trying to conquer and recreate respectively.The MayDecember Love Story InsideThe Girl With the Dragon TattooI think people are perverts Fincher says in a bonus featurette called Men Who Hate Women on theGirl With the Dragon Tattoo Bluray. Then he smiles devilishly. Ive maintained that. Thats the foundation of my career.Heres the thing Fincher. Is. Lying. Heres how we know His adaptation of Stieg Larssons The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo the Swedish gothnoir thriller that burned up Hudson Booksellers across the globe is a sweet almost saccharine love story. Forget about the rape the rape revenge the torture chamber the international gunrunning scandal the tattoos the incest and the bonecold Swedish winter. This is a heartwarming story about a weathered older man becoming reenergized by an exciting young woman who is smarter and craftier than he. Its no wonder the press tour for Dragon Tattoo became one long pantomime about weathered 49yearold Fincher and his young muse Rooney Mara  with whom hed bonded on The Social Network  and the prospects of a potential affair. Consider this fawning cryptic exchange between the two that opens an Interview magazine conversation.Fincher So my understanding is that there was an altercation at a wedding with an enthusiastic possibly inebriated mid20s male who without your consent decided to lift you into the air.Mara Yes.Fincher And then dance with you as if you were some kind of toy.Mara Yes.Fincher And you responded by grasping his larynx  with extreme prejudice.Mara I very calmly advised him that I could Fincher Do bodily harm.Mara Yes that I could do serious bodily harm and that he should probably put me down.Fincher I cant tell you how happy that makes me.Mara Why I dont know if it was so much a Lisbeth Salander moment.Fincher No what I like is that it was a Rooney Mara moment.Is this moviestar mythmaking or outandout flirting It hardly matters. Lisbeth Salander the ghoulchic heroine of Dragon Tattoo is an intriguingly obvious idea of sensuality for Fincher who examines her in repose throughout the movie. She is lithe and dark her skin a pallid gray. She looks like one of his neatly appointed sets soundtracked by Suicidal Tendencies. Her partner and paramour the disgraced journalist turned detective Mikael Blomkvist is a wounded great man driven to solitude and the whims of a wealthy family. They are an unlikely pair but they meet at the perfect time.Dragon Tattoo has a bad reputation or none at all but revisiting it reveals a shocking ingenuity and a bittersweet point of view Life sucks buy a motorcycle. And before the sequelanticipating ending3 Fincher puts us through the paces of blossoming love with romcom efficacy. There isnt one distinct sequence that takes us inside the Spencer TracyandKatharine Hepburnstyle romantic negotiation happening here. Instead we get all the beats.The MeetCuteThe Older Man ReminiscesThe Witty ReparteeThe ConsummationThe Morning AfterThe Revenge on the Maniacal Serial Killer Hiding Under Their Noses the Whole TimeThe ConfessionThe Reluctant FarewellAt its conclusion it all feels a bit like Brief Encounter a love felt deeply and then retired. By the time of Dragon Tattoo Fincher had been everywhere Hed been a box office king a commercial artiste an awardsmonger and a puzzledover technician. But hed never been a lover. In fact aside from the more traditionally gooey and unearned loveacrosstheages in Benjamin Button the last significant romance in his films consisted of the psychosexual encounters of Marla Singer and Tyler Durden. And we know the tenor of that coupling. So look at Dragon Tattoo again. Its love minus zero no limits.And Now a Word From Our SponsorsIts cool how one of the most accomplished feature film directors of the last 20 years is also one of the most influential commercial and music video auteurs of all time. Always nice to have a plan B. Over the last few years Finchers output in these fields has slowed but he still finds time for them now and then. In 2013 he shot the video for Justin Timberlakes Suit and Tie and just recently four new Gap commercials of his hit the airwaves.This is not a oneforme oneforthem situation. Fincher clearly likes making commercials. You can imagine the pride in his voice when he talks about the way he shot the advertising campaign for his Netflix series House of Cards. He seems to take it as seriously as directing the first two episodes of the first season. Maybe the its just business nature of television advertising and music videos appeals to Finchers cynical worldview. And after all nobody said these acts of commercial creativity werent creative.The SequenceLets not get into the semiotics of normcore clothing commercials or J.T.s dance moves. This is just a note to say that for a guy capable of making colors look claustrophobic Fincher makes blackandwhite look just like heaven.Maybe he sees it as an escape. Hes obsessed with movies  perhaps blackandwhite represents some kind of dream world. Or maybe money just feels good.This article initially misidentified the Transamerica Pyramid as the Prudential Building.FincherAlso penned by Buttons screenwriter Eric Roth.Said sequel is likely not coming at least not from Fincher.
