Read ourprivacy noticeDavid Fincher is notorious for his relentless filmmaking style whereby he makes his cast shoot certain scenes for hours and hours until he captures what he set out to achieve. It turns out his work on the first season of Mindhunter was no exception.Despite the fasterpaced schedule of television Fincher and lead star Jonathan Groff  who plays FBI agent Holden Ford  revealed the extent the filmmaker went to ensure the success of a particular scene.Gathered at an FYC event on Friday 1 June Fincher  who directed four episodes  detailed that the scene in question featuring serial killer Jerry Brudos Happy Anderson lasted for a hefty nineandahalf minutes and was shot using three cameras around 75 times.IndieWire reports that while Groff and costar Holt McCallany Bill Tench quickly adapted to Finchers rigorous approach Anderson was more taken aback.RecommendedHow serial killer Ed Kemper helped FBI agents understand other crimesThe scene with Happy Anderson was 11 pages he explained. We had three cameras outside the cage and wed do a nineandahalfminute take. Then Id walk in with a yellow pad filled with singlespaced notes to Groff OK thats a joke you cant toss that off. And this This is a statement. Make sure thats a statement. And Jonathan would be there going okay okay. Then wed do another nineminute take and hed do all that stuff I asked and Id go to Holt and go over four pages of notes with him. And Happy was like What Were really going to do this every timeHe continues We didnt have a break well we broke for lunch  I would say we did it 75 times in the day.Fincher is wellknown for being a perfectionist with reports claiming he was averaging around 50 takes for each scene in films Zodiac and Gone Girl.McCallany waded in stating he didnt mind adding I find when you do something over and over again you discover things. When you guys would say take 14 or take 20 suddenly something becomes apparent to you that you didnt really realise. Its not that we were making huge changes but the subtle adjustments we made or small adjustments David will give you can make a big difference in the way a scene plays out. So Im a fan of doing a lot of takes.27 horror films that will actually terrify you Show all 2712727 horror films that will actually terrify you 27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Orphanage 2007Directed by J.A. Bayona  Both my selections on this list mark the two instances in which Ive actively cried in a cinema out of fear if you can believe thats possible. Though J.A. Bayonas ghostly tale is a beautiful throwback to Gothic conventions which lace its hauntings with powerful emotions and warnings that kid with the sack on its head traumatised me for life. Worse I came back home and remembered the flat Id newly moved in to had a cupboard with no key and no clue as to what may be contained inside considering whats eventually found to be hiding in the basement of The Orphanage  yeah I didnt sleep that night  Clarisse Loughrey27 horror films that will actually terrify you Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1956Directed by Don Siegel  Another film that doesnt rely upon or need special effects to make you a bit scared to turn the telly off when youve finished watching it. So disturbing in fact that the studio insisted the ending was changed to make it less dark before it was released. The 1978 remake is very good too  Jon Di Paolo27 horror films that will actually terrify you House of Usher 1960Directed by Roger Corman  Im a huge fan of Roger Cormans House of Usher 1960 the first in a series of Edgar Allan Poe adaptations the schlock producer made with the gloriously hammy Vincent Price. The latter stars as Roderick Usher a sickly aristocrat living in queasy isolation with his sister in the crumbling mansion of the title. Cormans Poe films became increasingly formulaic and campy but this one really delivers  Joe Sommerlad27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Exorcist 1973Directed by William Friedkin  There have been countless movies about demonic possession but none of them have managed to be quite as memorable as William Friedkins The Exorcist. This film has received as much critical acclaim as it has attention from terrified audiences decade after decade. Every sequence will offset your internal rhythm while scenes of a disfigured little girl Linda Blairs Regan crawling on the ceiling will haunt you for many nights to come  Zlata Rodionova27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 1974Directed by Tobe Hooper I am living proof that Tobe Hoopers seminal horror should not be watched at the age of 11 between the horrifying dinner table scene  where the cries of Marilyn Burns Sally are laughed at by her cannibalistic captors  and that final shot of Leatherface Gunnar Hansen flailing his chainsaw about aimlessly in the air The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is the horror film I would least like to watch again  Jacob Stolworthy27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Shining 1980Directed by Stalney Kubrick This Stanley Kubrick classic doesnt necessarily fit into the horror box but for audiences chasing a real sense of unease The Shining fits the bill. Based on Stephen Kings novel of the same name the film tells the story of the Torrance family who hole up in an isolated hotel for the closed winter season. Things take a macabre turn as an evil presence begins to influence father Jack Jack Nicholson to undertake a murderous rampage. In typical Kubrick style nothing is as it seems  Megan Townsend27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Watcher in the Woods 1980Directed by John Hough I really enjoy watching horror films even though they never scare me thats not including The Watcher in the Woods of course. Yes  Disney film The Watcher in the Woods. Theres just something inherently unsettling about the films frequent use of mirrors that freaked me out and the way writing and apparitions suddenly appear in them. Who knew a Disney film could give you nightmares for weeks  Richard Williams27 horror films that will actually terrify you Brazil 1985Directed by Terry Gilliam  Every Halloween I consider wearing one of the hideous baby face masks from Brazil and every year I chicken out for fear of my reflection. A sinister Michael Palin is also extremely disorientating. But nothing beats the sinking dread of a tyrannical behemoth bureaucracy swallowing you whole and turning your dreams into nightmares. Having said that Brazil is also my favourite film  Joe VeseyByrne27 horror films that will actually terrify you Candyman 1992Directed by Bernard Rose  I was waaay too young when I first saw Bernard Roses Candyman and it still scares me to this day. Its the story of a PhD student Virginia Madsen who visits an impoverished Chicago tenement building to investigate an urban myth whispered among the residents about a hookhanded ghost stalking the corridors. Naturally she soon realises the phantom is all too real. Philip Glasss delicate music box score is eerie indeed and Tony Todd utterly mesmerising in the lead. Candyman manages to be both sincerely frightening and an important statement about the legacy of slavery and the injustices still endured by Black America as relevant now as it was in 1992. Say his names three times before the mirror I dare you  Joe Sommerlad27 horror films that will actually terrify you Screamers 1995Directed by Christian Duguay Screamers is based on a Philip K Dick story and his trademark otherworldliness and fascination with the dark side of AIhuman nature give it some genuinely chilling twists. Plus theres robots with sharp blades that tear out of the ground and chop you to bits  Jon Di Paolo27 horror films that will actually terrify you Scream 1996Directed by Wes Craven Okay hear me out. Scream might not be a highquality film or achieve anywhere near the art of modern indie horrors being made on a fraction of the budget but its antagonist still haunts me and Ill tell you why zombies dont scare me demons dont scare me ghosts dont scare me but humans do. None of horrors clichd evil beings are as terrifying as a human on a murderous rampage with no apparent motive. Ghostface is gangly awkward fallible and all the scarier for it. The way he runs around like a toddler blindingly slashing at the air is chilling and an unwelcome reminder that if you did die at the hands of a psychopath it wouldnt involve a cinematic wellplaced spike but a floundering struggle  Christopher Hooton Sportsphoto Ltd.Allstar27 horror films that will actually terrify you Funny Games 1997Directed by Michael Haneke Whilst not the first film that comes to mind when considering the horror genre this film for me is as scary as it gets. At first the violence seems irrational and nihilistic but the most terrifying thing about Michael Hanekes Austrian psychological thriller about two men who randomly torture a middleclass family in their idyllic vacation home is the fact that we become the driving force behind the horror. Breaking down the fourth wall spoilers ahead one of the ohsopolite psychopaths rewinds a scene that doesnt go his way and gives us a much more gruesome ending to the film otherwise as he says straight to camera wed all be deprived of our pleasure  Kirsty Major27 horror films that will actually terrify you Ringu 1998Directed by Hideo Nakata  Make no mistake if the Hollywood version of Ring is a decent remake the Japanese original is far more petrifying. There is just something inexplicable about Asian horror films rooted in Japanese folklore and ghost stories that makes them far creepier. Watching it for the very first time is like living a nightmare as Sadako crawls out of the well youll find yourself automatically pushing against the back of the sofa in the hope she will not eventually end up in your living room. The movie put me off watching TV and picking up the phone for a couple of weeks at least  Zlata RodionovaPhotograph AllstarOmega27 horror films that will actually terrify you Mulholland Drive 2001Directed by David Lynch  For me the scariest moment in any movie ever has to be from David Lynchs Mulholland Drive. The scene happens around 10 minutes into the film but is sold bold and confident in its ability to scare you it actually tells you exactly how it is going to do so. By using dream logic distorted sound and strange camera movements the scene transports you into a nightmare turned reality for one of the characters in the scene. These five minutes are exhausting to behold but it is a masterclass in how to effectively use the jump scare. This segment perfectly encapsulates the rest of this beautiful confusing and surreal movie as you never know what lies around the corner on Mulholland Drive  Greg Evans27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Others 2001Directed by Alejandro Amenbar  This chiller doesnt rely on CGI or special effects to be scary  its all about building tension through oldfashioned dramatic tricks and it does it brilliantly. Nicole Kidman delivers an absolute tour de force and it is riveting and affecting as well as liable to make you jump out of your seat  Jon Di Paolo 27 horror films that will actually terrify you Dark Water 2002Directed by Hideo Nakata  One of the horror films that still scares the heck out of me. Its by Hideo Nakata who made the equally as scary The Ring. Hollywood did a remake with Jennifer Connelly in 2005 but there is definitely something about the original Japanese version that leaves you with a haunting feeling  Mars El Brogy27 horror films that will actually terrify you Signs 2002Directed by M. Night Shyamalan  Seeing that alien for the first time as he gets unceremoniously booted from a Brazilian kids birthday party still gets me just as it did when I ran from the room the first time I saw it. I still resent that broadcasters blatant flouting of TV dogma by playing so much tensioninducing build up before the action itself  Charlie Atkin27 horror films that will actually terrify you Paranormal Activity 2009Directed by Oren Peli  The only film Ive ever watched where I considered switching off halfway through out of sheer terror. The tension ratchets up endlessly as the found footage style adds to the claustrophobia. A decision was made long ago never to watch it again  Tom EmburyDennis  Or a cautionary tale for leaving your leg dangling out of your bed. Injecting fresh life into the foundfootage formula the first Paranormal Activity managed to induce chills the world over by the simple  and rather frugal  use of a static camera set up by couple Katie and Micah all in the hope they can learn whats going bump in the night. With every new nighttime scene  each displaying more demonic hauntings than the last  your sounds of terror will become more audible.  Jacob Stolworthy  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you Black Swan 2010Directed by Darren Aronofsky  Guaranteed to make your skin crawl Darren Aronofskys 2010 take on classic ballet Swan Lake is a textbook example of psychological horror. Ballerina Nina Natalie Portman lands the coveted role of the Swan Princess only to find she cannot engage with her evil alterego  the Black Swan. When Nina attempts to engage with her darkside she loses herself altogether  Megan Townsend27 horror films that will actually terrify you VHS 2012Directed by Various  The rising crop of horror filmmakers Adam Wingard and Ti West included teamed up to make VHS an anthology film comprised of six disturbing vignettes if one doesnt scare you senseless its a sure bet the next will. The opening two linger in my memory each taking familiar concepts  a night out with your pals and a honeymoon  and adding a slant of depravity thatll chill you to the core. Next time someone tells you they like you run a mile  Jacob Stolworthy27 horror films that will actually terrify you Oculus 2013Directed by Mike Flanagan  Psychological thrillers can be terrifying enough as they are but throw in a spooky supernatural storyline and youll have nightmares for days or at least I did. Oculus tells the story of a woman determined to clear her brothers name in the brutal murder of their parents. The siblings suspect supernatural forces are at play with an antique mirror being at the root of all the evil. Suffice to say the first thing I did as soon as I got home from the cinema was to throw a blanket over the giant mirror sitting in my room  you know just in case  Chantal DaSilva27 horror films that will actually terrify you It Follows 2014Directed by David Robert Mitchell  David Robert Mitchells synthencrusted nightmare shows sounds essential role in the genre. It Follows premises itself on the very simple idea that something is out there something indistinguishable from your fellow man except that theyre always headed straight for you. No matter where you may be and no matter where you may run to. A figure walking down the street may seem ordinary at first but Disasterpeaces score here turns that image into paralysing fright. Seeing this in the cinema tucked up right next to the loudspeaker as the synths reached their climax and blood pooled the screen unashamedly made me cry like a kid left behind in a shopping mall  Clarisse Loughrey  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you Green Room 2015Directed by Jeremy Saulnier  Patrick Stewart isnt the first name that comes to mind when I think of horror but 2015s Green Room left me terrified suspense from start to finish with an uncharacteristically dark turn from Stewart as detached neoNazi leader Darcy Banker  Ronan OShea  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Invitation 2015Directed by Karyn Kusama  You look great.  Ive started this new class its changed my life. Weve all been there. A dinner party with old friends someone you deliberately havent seen in a while proselytizing about their latest fad diet class or retreat. The Invitation takes that a step further Will takes his new partner for dinner at his exwifes house joining a cast of friends who havent seen each other since he lost his son over a year ago. As the wine flows and two new guests join the old crew Will begins to realise that theyve been brought here for another reason all together  Kirsty Major  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you Under the Shadow 2016Directed by Babak Anvari  For anyone who has seen Under the Shadow it should come as no surprise that Iranianborn Babak Anvaris film is Britains Oscar entry for best Best Foreign Language Film. Though short in length a brief 74 mins every scene drips with intensity. The 80s set film follows a mother and her young daughter as they struggle with a demon haunting their apartments building in wartorn Iran. Alongside the nightmarish torment of the Djinn the building is being bombed by militant forces meaning the threat comes from both inside and out culminating in one of the years best horror films  Jack Shepherd  Available on Netflix27 horror films that will actually terrify you The Witch 2016Directed by Robert Eggers  The Witch is set in 17th contrary New England and follows a family banished from their Puritan plantation. When the youngest suddenly disappears the blame falls upon Anya TaylorJoys young character though she knows something more is at play. As the film progresses stranger and stranger things start to happen all with a heavy twang of religious imagery. The jump scares may not be frequent but the atmosphere is utterly terrifying  Jack Shepherd27 horror films that will actually terrify you Raw 2017Directed by Julia Ducournau  All good horror reflects our deepest collective fears back at us and Raw gives us this with a side of human flesh. Justine is a firstyear veterinary student who at once fasts and purges lets loose and withdraws scaling the highs and lows that coming of age brings. She throws herself with abandon at human flesh both literally and metaphorically  with an older sister whose destructive behaviour leaves her with little in the way of a role model to help navigate her newly burgeoning desires  Kirsty MajorFincher also went to extreme lengths to ensure Cameron Brittons character Ed Kemper retained the eerie atmosphere required to make him the series highlight.It became really obvious coming out of the first readthrough that Make sure Cameron doesnt talk to anyone. He cant fraternise with anyone. I dont want this to be a social thing. He has to literally come from Pluto and be in the show. He cant be indoctrinated into what anyone else is up to. It has to be that this guy shows up hes got all the time in the world  13 life sentences  and hes going to tell you what you want to know.
