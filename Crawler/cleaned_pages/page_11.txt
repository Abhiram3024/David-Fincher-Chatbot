Michael Bay passed on the project saying the script needed work talk about funny and it was later reported that Fincher passed because it wasnt his thing. Ive always wondered how Finchers name got in the mix and what Finchers vision for SpiderMan would have been. Recently Fincher sat down to answer questions for The Guardian and the filmmaker was asked about the project.I was asked if I might be interested in the first SpiderMan... Im not interested in doing A Superhero. The thing I liked about SpiderMan was I liked the idea of a teenager the notion of this moment in time when youre so vulnerable yet completely invulnerable. But I wasnt interested in the genesis I just couldnt shoot somebody being bitten by a radioactive spider  just couldnt sleep knowing Id done that. ... I went in and told them what I might be interested in doing and they hated it.I also once heard that Finchers pitch involved the death of Gwen Stacy and at one point he relented to the idea of showing some of Spideys origin or maybe preorigin in flashbacks. Ive also read elsewhere rumors that Fincher wanted Edward Norton to play Peter Parker not sure if it is true or not.As much as I love David Finchers incredible films and as much as Im curious to see what he would have done Im kinda glad he never had the chance. I wasnt a big fan of the first SpiderMan movie but to me Sam Raimis SpiderMan 2 nailed the comic book. Im not sure the tone story and characters could have been presented any better.Recommended
