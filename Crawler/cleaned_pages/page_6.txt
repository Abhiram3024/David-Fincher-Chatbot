Some actors have clearly gelled with the filmmaker working with him more than once Brad Pitt Rooney Mara while others found the process exhausting and creatively unrewarding Jake Gyllehaal. All this is to say that on Finchers currently in production Gone Girl its a not shock to learn that once again hes doing everything he can to get the most he can out of a scene.The Southeast Missourian recently chronicled an afternoon of shooting inCape Girardeau an extrasfilled sequencethat the paper noted found Fincher filming over and over again for several hours. The scene featured over one hundred people acting as media and regular citizens chasing down a police car with someone of interest inside. Approximately 20 takes were done of this scene which according to Finchers longtime producerCean Chaffin is on the low end for this film. She told the paper Fincher is averaging about 50 takes per scene in Gone Girl a figure markedly up from 27per scene in previous movies.  its an odd business. A lot of times its more like doing construction than painting a picture she said.So why does Fincher insist on this methodI hate earnestness in performance usually by Take 17 the earnestness is gone he toldThe New York Timesin 2007. And when we spoke to the director in 2010 he shared what he told Justin Timberlake before the singeractor signed up for The Social Network which goes a long way in explaining Finchers process.Were going to microfractally explore this text cause all there is in this movie is people talking. Were going to pick that shit out of pepper. Were going to find the moments between the moments that move and resonate. And if youre not willing to hit that hole a lot of times dont do this. Because its going to be agony for you. If the charge for you is wardrobe malfunction youre not going to get that. Theres not going to be a lot surprises here youre going to surprise yourself. Im going to have you do it until you have gone past memorizing it gone past knowing your own name until we can get all of the the physical nonsense so ingrained that we can get to what the actual text is.In short Fincher wants the words to feel natural real and lived in almost like a reflex and thus they will leap off the page more authentically. Whether or not you agree it clearly has been working for Fincher so why change what isnt broken Filming continues on Gone Girl with the movie slated to hit theaters on October 3 2014.
