This time around well be talking about Alien 3 the 1992 trilogy capper that should have oneupped James Camerons Aliens 1986 just as that film managed to outdo Ridley Scotts original from 1979. Known for its several scrapped scripts and overwhelming studio intervention Alien 3 also marked the directorial feature debut of an upandcoming filmmaker by the name of David Fincher.Ever heard of himAt that time Fincher was only known for directing music videos and no one could have guessed just how celebrated of an auteur he would become in the years to follow. However the third Alien movie wasnt the best Hollywood resume builder as the designbycommittee approach the death of Hicks and Newt at the very start and a sometimes unconvincing Xenomorph puppet composited into certain scenes with some CGI sprinkled in all culminated in a critical and box office flop an occurrence the Alien IP had never seen before. Up until the early 90s the franchise had to quote the Nostromos Ash been a perfect organism.In the years since Alien 3s release and negative reception fans have sort of warmed up to the project not regarding it as a total mess. Even so Fincher has disowned the movie and refuses to speak about it in any capacity. Three years later his prestigious reputation would begin to take shape with the release of S7ven.But what happened in that alternate reality where Alien 3 was not only a worth followup to Aliens but a true realization of David Finchers unique and often dark filmmaking style What if hed been given a free reignMORE FOR YOUWhere To Find Donald Trumps Hot New SneakersTrue Detective Night Country Episode 6 Review  A Truly Embarrassing Season FinaleGoogle Teases Innovative New Android Abilities With Gemini AI20th Century FoxLooking back it was a very very very bumpy ride for everyone Lucinda Syson CSA who worked as a casting assistant to Priscilla John on the film told me during a phone interview. I think David Fincher turned out to be an absolute genius and I think sometimes there is this old fashioned thing about youthful firsttimers or whatever not really knowing what theyre doing but I think he was an inspired genius and was kind of overshadowed by some of the filmmaking protocol. That film couldve been much of that sort of Edgar Allan Poe style. It was heading in that direction and I think that if David had been given his way it would have turned out great. I mean he was exploring too at that point. Coming out the other side of that film he went on to S7ven and blew everyones minds and so I think if hed been allowed a little bit more of his own reign in the first one I think it wouldve been a different film.Since that baptism by fire as she calls it Syson has gone on to become an extremely accomplished and talented casting director assembling actors and ensembles for major projects like XMen First Class Mission Impossible  Rogue Nation Wonder Woman and the remake of Aladdin. Shes also the casting director for Wonder Woman 1984 Terminator Dark Fate and the currentlyuntitled Game of Thrones prequel project about to start filming for HBO. Before you ask I did try to get her to tease those things and she was as you might guess incredibly tightlipped.Lets just say theyre all brilliant and Im thrilled to be part of them. Im absolutely thrilled to be part of those projects. I feel very privileged she said.20th Century FoxGetting back to Alien 3 though the plot revolves around Ellen Ripley Sigourney Weaver crashlanding on a prison planet inhabited by condemned criminals who get a shot at redemption when a Xenomorph gets loose on the compound. In addition to Weaver the cast also includes Charles Dance Charles S. Dutton Pete Postlethwaite and Lance Henriksen.Things get even more complicated when Ripley learns that she is playing host to a Xenomorph Queen and ends up sacrificing herself before the organism can fall into the wrong hands.It was a very rocky road and incredible to be there for David Finchers firstever feature Syson added. I think I learned an enormous amount on that film because I was on the set. When I wasnt in the casting office I was helping on set with actors and things.Follow me onTwitterorLinkedIn.Check outmywebsite.Josh WeissEditorial StandardsPrintReprints  Permissions
