Dark in content dark in tone and especially dark in visual aesthetics. Characters are shrouded in low light levels even in direct sunlight. Its ominous dread inducing and spectacular. It also bucks the trend of high contrast blueteal blockbuster looks that have been almost unavoidable in Films and TV for the last 10 years.I recently completed a color grade on Zombie Night a feature film starring Darryl Hannah and Anthony Michael Hall in which I applied a similar look that emphasized a darker feel with reduced highlights and color casts to set the tone. Here are some examples from Mr. Finchers last 3 films that showcase this lookand a color palette board from the film I just graded.House of Cards in Washington D.C. Metro rail stationThe Godfather is commonly referenced as one of the first films to break from conventional cinematography and go dark. Gordon Willis ASC was named The Prince of Darkness for his conscious decision to use low light levels and soft overhead lighting. He went as far as opting for not having the reflection of lights in the eyes of the actors. The studios were not happy director Francis Ford Coppola was worriedbut the resulting cinematography and impact of the film speaks for itself. The tone and dramatic weight of the epic story were aided and elevated by the Mr. Willis breathtaking work.The Godfather proved less is more in lighting dark scenesDavid Fincher is well known for his striking visual style and the immersive worlds he creates. Ive been lucky enough to work in his offices and speak with Academy Award winning editors Angus Wall and Kirk Baxter who cut The Social Network and The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo. Their attention to detail and level of absolute perfection is second to none. Nothing that ends up on the screen is accidental or arbitraryevery frame is dissected and decided upon. In my viewFinchers visuals have leaned towards a more natural realistic yet absolutely visceral feel over his last 3 projects. Lets take a peek at what that entailsThe Social NetworkNatural yet stylized images from The Social NetworkFrom the first scene in a bara new aesthetic was displayed in The Social Network. Its darkbut not with crushed blacks. As a viewer there is a difference between crushed blacks and compressed dynamics of light. There is clear detail in the shadows but the highlights are lowered and colored. If 100 is pure white lightmany of the whites in Finchers last 3 projects are at 90 roughly which constricts the perceived latitude of the image. These whites are also tinted towards the overall color of the scene. Orange is infused into both day and night scenes in The Social Network. Often blue is the go to nighttime color but not so in The Social Network. There are no rulesits what feels right and I found it extremely effective here.The Girl With The Dragon TattooDark visuals for a dark story in The Girl With The Dragon TattooThe Girl With The Dragon Tattoo display a continuation of this visual palette. In the winter setting of ambiguous sunlight and endless nightFincher again compresses the whites and keeps clean and legible blacks. Even though so much occurs at nightthe viewer never struggles to see what is occurring or gets lost in the visuals. From glasslined offices to nighttime exterior excursionseverything is pristine and clearly visible even when the light levels are extremely low. This can attributed to the ample latitude of the RED camera the careful cinematography of Jeff Cronenweth and the color grade itself. The tinting of both orange and blue to entire scenes further blends the color palette of scenes and delivers a very hyperreal look. Its set in the real world but pushes the boundaries to enhance the drama of the story.House of CardsHouse of Cards further pushes the limits or darknessA new low is reached in House of Cards. Scenes play out in extreme darkness. At the inauguration of the Presidentthe scene is played out during the day but it feels and looks like midnight. The sunlight is white but it is so muted and desaturated that it seems like it is only there as a courtesy to illuminate the scene. The mids and blacks blend into each other to the point that the whole scene feels black and white. Kevin Spaceys character is framed dead center and looks to the camera during the shothe includes the viewer into his world and speaks directly to the camera. Its eerie creepy and supremely effective. I saw the raw RED footage at Finchers post production offices and all of it was perfectly exposed and dare I saybright. I can see that the final images were all a creative decision to push the limits and deliver the images that he saw in his head.During other daylight scenes the same approach is applied. Its never blinding sunshineonly the impression that it is daytime. To further imply the constricting and murky world of Washington politicsnighttime scenes often allow just enough information to barely make out the characters. We strain to see the emotions and thought process of the actors as they are blanketed by low light levels and no fill lights to make them pop. This is a new kind of realism in cinematography where conventional lighting is thrown out and the onus is on us to extract what we need from what little we can see. Its enoughbut barely. It makes the audience work and pay attention to keep up with the story. Visual darkness represents and defines the cutthroat morality of the series. I personally love it. Some dont. To each their own.GONE GIRLThe darkness gets deeper in GONE GIRLMost recently GONE GIRL 2014 continues and expands upon the darkness and shrouds the characters within world of buried secrets and impenetrable blackness. Make no mistakethe visual depiction is not murky or muddyit is a dismal colorful bleakness that infuses and envelops the film. It matches the tone of the tale.My takeaway from watching the last 4 projects by David Fincher is that hes utilizing quickly evolving technologies RED color correction LED lighting to redefine the visual boundaries of what is the minimum needed to represent and tell the story. Its bold and radically different from lets sayan episode of CSI or Transformers. Its reality enhanced and a new take on what is considered natural light filmmaking. Then in post productioncolor grading the midtones and highlights are lowered to bring down the overall brightness BUT most importantlythe blacks are never crushed so that the shadow detail is always retained. The final image is Dark Clarity and matches the mood and tone of his last 3 projects.Zombie NightFinallyhere are all 2050 color graded shots from the film Zombie Night which is scheduled to come out Halloween 2013. I chose to embody many of the principles and sensibilities that David Fincher used on my grade of the film. I will follow up with a more detailed examination and explanation of my post production process once the film comes out and Im allowed to share all my assets and workflow. Zombie Night was shot on RED and I had 9 days to grade the entire feature on Davinci Resolve in my home studio. I was given three 4TB drives and colored at 12 resolution to get realtime playback. A lot of coffee and vodka made the whirlwind 9 days fly by. I exported to ProRes HQ and kicked out a XML for the final online.Zombie Night  2050 RED shots color graded in 9 daysThank you for hanging on to the end and letting me ramble about only one of the aspects that contribute to the making of an effective film. Ive been watching the choices in David Finchers last 3 projects and thought it worthy to discuss in the way that I see it and its relevance in the current state of cinematography and storytelling.

Living in Baltimore having seen many real locations now onscreen Ive been fascinated with all things House of Cards  Social Network. You were spot on in illustrating how color can be such an emotive thing. Cant wait to see how this influenced your grading.

I have a basic idea of how to do it but would like to see how you would do it. Also I read the low budget action cutting post you did and i cant wait to test that out especially cutting 2 frames before impact and Ill shoot at 22 fps.
