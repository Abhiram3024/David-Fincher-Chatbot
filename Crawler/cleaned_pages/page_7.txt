The first two episodes of that landmark series saw one of American cinemas most fastidious craftsmen make his first foray into television. NowDavid Fincher is back and doubling down helming four episodes of 2017s most anticipated bingefest an adaptation of the memoir by FBI agent John Douglas the criminal profiler who served as inspiration for Jack Crawford in Thomas Harris bestseller The Silence of the Lambs. Fincher gaveus a call for an epic conversation about all things MINDHUNTER.LWLies Was MINDHUNTER a project you developed yourselfFincher Yeah. Lets see Charlize Theron called me around 20092010. It was definitely before House of Cards. She owned the book and had the idea to develop it as a TV show so we started talking about what it could be. Id never done TV. I was like I dont know enough about it. We developed it together with a writer that she had sort of already hired. I was only kind of tangentially involved I wasnt in the drivers seat and more of the mind that if something can come of this Ill certainly direct the pilot.We went down a road where I met with the writer Joe Penhall and laid out the things that Im not interested in the most important one being the notion that a fine line separates the FBI agent from the serial killer. I felt that it was well trawled I felt that it was a literary conceit and really had nothing to do with why I think people are interested in serial killers. I dont think people are interested in serial killers because theyre so much like them I think theyre interested in the aberrant because its so hard to understand. I really felt that this was an opportunity to reclaim not the genre because I hate the idea that serial killer films are a genre but more the idea that the serial killer is some kind of Wile E Coyote super genius.What else were you keen to avoidI laid out that I wasnt interested in the minute differences between the hunter and the hunted and Im not interested in an AB storyline. Im not interested in Heres what Batmans up to and heres what the Jokers up to. I wanted to talk about the late 1970s postCivil Rights postsexual revolution postWatergate and postSon of Sam where the FBI has to brace its boots and try to reinvigorate itself in order to become relevant again. They were at a particular lull where theyd been responsible for the house of the SLA burning down they were in a valley in terms of their public relations. I felt that that was a really interesting time.At what point did you decide to make it about this fictional character Holden Ford removing John Douglas from the narrativeThat was Joe Penhall.Once wed decided that we werent going to use the first script written by the first writer Charlize suggested Joe. Hed written The Road and she really loved working with him. We pitched him what we were thinking and he went away and came back with what was the real epiphany which was that we cant do it with Ressler and Douglas. We need to be able to separate these characters where we need to separate them. Were not only talking about a time and a place we had to be able to apportion the characters certain behavioural traits that we needed to dramatise the story that we wanted to tell. Joes solution and I think it was the right one was that we needed to fictionalise. We cant get into or deal with who really did what. Were gonna stay with the people who were interviewed and were gonna talk about and dramatise those interviews but Joe was the one who said I cant be beholden to this book. I need to be able to move to draw the best drama and not be worried about who would get credit for what.There are a lot of ideas that need to be transmitted to the audience in terms of what the lead character is trying to do so that when the first serial killer interview with Ed Kemper comes theyre effectively asking the same questions of him as the FBI agent. You once said The first rule of cinema is that a movie has to teach an audience how to watch it.I sent it to a friend of mine whos a stonecold genius just this great screenwriter. I showed him the first two episodes and his comment was really interesting. He said Youve done the exact opposite of television where your character is always the perfect person to solve the dilemma of the show. They may have a problem with alcohol or may have lost a loved one but theyre always the perfect person to wrestle with the problem that the show is going to posit. He said what weve done here is taken somebody whos in some existential malaise  which is something that Joe and I talked about a lot  and its the most difficult thing to dramatise someone who doesnt feel like hes accomplishing what it is he needs to accomplish.Joe did some really interesting thinking about how we introduce a character and introduce his naivete. I mean John Douglas is not a naive guy Holden is a much more naive character. But through this naivete we get to experience how Quantico works and what they wanted from him and how they expected him to behave how they didnt consider themselves to be outmoded and outside the vanguard as it relates to criminology. So we got to experience a lot of that stuff in the first hour. Thats not to say thats the only way to tell a story but we were looking to do a bit more of a hybrid between a movie and a TV show.What does that look like to your mindI dont know that the golden age of television is really television as we know it. Its something thats grown out of certain expectations blurring and subverting a lot of those expectations in surprising ways and I really do feel that whats interesting about the Netflix model  that they dont have to worry about capturing an audience on a given night that they dont have to worry about cliffhangers  is that the way people experience it is much more like literature. You can set the remote down like youd set the book down on your bedside table. It has a different relationship to its audience. The movie business has become about the urgency of Friday to Monday and network television has become about From the makers of using the hit show as the introduction to the new show. Then theres Netflix which is about Look when you get around to it well be here. Its a different problem it requires different things of the audiences time. Ultimately I think it requires a different kind of television.Holden uses these interviews as a means to an end as the toolsto unlockthe criminal mindI think its later that that becomes the case.What he sees is the value of these conversations in illuminating Look the FBI was established to chase Baby Face Nelson from one state into another. Thats how it came to be. It was a never about sitting with them and asking Why did you want to become a bank robber In the Depression no one really cared what the reasons were behind someones impetus. It was pretty fickle it was monetary gain. It was a case of I dont have whats in this bank but I have a tommy gun and Im gonna take whats not rightfully mine. There was a pretty clear cut motive.Do you think he knows where all this is headingI dont even think he knows what hes touched upon that theres something to this idea of the unconscious or the subconscious speaking through these rash explosive compulsive acts of violence. There was something to the things that Edmund Kemper was doing that only he knew and ultimately that was the attraction for me the notion that a monolithic bureaucracy could only inform itself through having some kind of empathy for people who should be beneath our contempt. That in order to have a conversation with someone who is so unlike you that you cant even imagine it and who has things that are driving them that you cant even fathom you have to have compassion even for your enemy to understand why they hate you and why they do what they do.I thought that was interesting. I dont think Id ever seen that. That was one of the hallmarks of Douglas project. He was very good at testing and sparring with these people but he was also very good at engaging them and pulling them out so we could have a better understanding. What they do is inhuman but they are human. He offered an empathetic vacuum a place where you dont judge them you simply listen to them. That was not a J Edgar Hoover idea that was very much sparked by having to change. When David Berkowitz was hunting every night through the boroughs of Manhattan it was something about these people and these circumstances and this location that spoke to him and thats when he pulled the trigger. For whatever reason they couldnt get the manacles on him for a year and he held this entire city in terrified thrall. It was an interesting thing this idea of a guy in a Mormon suit sitting down to talk to someone whos entirely unlike him. It was a pivot. It was a change in the bureau it was a change in criminology and a change in the way that people talked about aberrant behaviour.Youve spoken in the past about not liking to be seen to have a style of your own yet youve directed the first two episodes of MINDHUNTER which would presumably look different if say Asif Kapadia had directed them. Do the requirements of uniformity throughout the series mean that other directors will have to do a Fincher moving forwardsI hope not. Nothing makes a filmmaker more selfconscious than watching another filmmaker doing an interpretation of what youve done. The director of photography was fairly well versed in what the style was. The style is really just lets not be afraid of conversations. Its My Dinner with Andr the Giant. Theres a sequence with Jerry Brudos that Andrew Douglas did thats just a stainless steel picnic table inside a chainlink cage inside a maximum security concrete bunker that has razor wire over all the windows. The guy comes in and its a conversation about cigarettes whether they can unmanacle him whether he can fix the guys tape recorder. I know that there are filmmakers who if you presented them with a long scene of two guys over a picnic table would go Oh my god where do you go with thisWhen youre approaching a scene thats11 pages of dialogue is that all shot and cut in your head firstYoure always shooting coverage because coverage just means Look you can either embrace coverage like an interior housepainter as in I just need to get as many coats as I can but starting wide there are practical implications to taking two cameras and shooting as wide as you can as a lot of the time you can learn from them. A few takes and a master can just be a case of I gotta have a master or it can be So later when I get into this are you intending to move here Its plastic. You dont want to become a Disneyland animatronic you want to leave room for inspiration. We did not storyboard but if you say that youre a director I dont want you to become reliant on closeups.I want to see the physicality. I want to see the shoulders of this character. I like the worn nature of what these guys wear. How they walk when their gait can only be two feet. What does that do to you How bodies express. The slouch of somebody who has all the time in the world and the erect spine of the guy whos trying to glean something from them and how the FBI agent plays with his tie or rolls his eyes and is already packing his stuff to leave All that stuff goes into it and a lot of television is Get that Tony Scott closeup. We talked about all that stuff.Youre quite vocal about your loathing of the term auteur so much so that you basically gave it to Ed Kempers serial killer as a means of describing his oeuvre.My distaste for the term was exactly the intention. Like what the fuck What is he talking about The problem with auteurism is that it presupposes that one person can impress upon 95 people so clearly that the manifestation of whatever it is going on in your head can be clearly attributed to them. The reality of moviemaking is yknow its a rat fuck. Every day is a skirmish and you might escape every skirmish but there are injuries and there losses and there are things that you had10 meetings about that go off perfectly and there are things that youve had no meetings about that ended up taking eight of the 12 hours in the day because you didnt think it was going to be so complicated.	Shooting television is hard. You do a lot of weeping but its also invigorating.            So the notion that someone calls this perfect idealised version of the scene Its like the jetpropulsion industry the idea that something is windtunnel tested and is gonna go off the way its supposed to  it never goes off the way its supposed to. My issue with auteurism is how do you attribute a master plan to a happy accident There are certain things that you can count on. You have to work at it and you have to know what it is youre trying to do and impart that to an army of people who all have their own ideas about whats important.Everybody who comes on to a set looks at it from a slightly different standpoint. You cant say to the third violinist This is what the totality of the thing should sound like. You just need them to get them to do their thing. When you hear it it either moves you or it doesnt so you have to figure if it needs a little bit more of this or that. Thats happening in the rehearsal its happening in the coverage throughout the day. You hone in as you get tighter and tighter and tighter on people but youre also getting tighter in terms of time. Youre honing in on one little thing and then you do the same again in the edit with the sound effects with the music with the colour grading. Suddenly all this stuff comes together and the notion that anyone could say This is precisely what its going to look like to me is amazing.But there is a directorial perspective a subjectivity that is distinctively yours. That isnt perhaps as distant as Stanley Kubrick or as immersive as Steven Spielberg but thats definitely identifiable and consistent.And thats a decision. I love both those filmmakers. I like dispassion because I like what it does to the audience I like to see things as wide as I possibly can. I dont want to be in the middle of every transaction. Spielbergs staging in a lot of ways is about putting you in harms way. Jaws and Close Encounters are two of my favourite movies. But I look at the stories Im interested in telling or I look at the stories that I have been interested in telling and I sort of go Theres no place for that here. You pick and choose. The important thing is to know what you intend to impart. It comes from the aesthetic. There are things that you hold dear aesthetically there are things that you hold dear behaviourally there are ways that a scene unfolds that feel realistic to you. If youre responsible for how its all going to come off and for how its all going to come together theres no way that you cant inform that. The notion that someone is going to direct a film and not reveal what it is they like about cinema or how they prefer things to be revealed to them or the audience its impossible. Youre doomed to find your worth.I recently spoke toSteven Soderberghabout staging and the implications of film grammar and he brought up you and Spielberg describing you as savants. Do you think thats a fair assessmentYknow its trial and error. Anyone who does this job has to work at it. When you look at the minimalism of Logan Lucky you could mistake it for the Coen brothers in terms of its wide angle wit. Its diabolically complicated. It isnoteasy to do that. Even that bit in the trailer when Channing Tatums been fired and he throws his hard hard and the guy in the foreground is like What just happened Its just stunning. Its not easy shit to do.What are the practical differencesbetween film andTV Do you have the luxury of rehearsalNo youve got a show to put on. Its Mickey RooneyJudy Garland I have to put on a showThats the pressure of it. Its also kind of the beauty of it. Its a circus. Heres the company and the script is as good as it can be by Tuesday because thats the day those nine pages are gonna get shot.So no 99 takesIve only shot 99 takes a couple of times When you have six months to prep something thats going to end up being two hours long on which youve spent a year figuring out the tech and another six months getting everyone prepared for it You can tell people why all these moments link and why youre expecting XYZ so there are much fewer surprises. There are more surprises in television. You have to finish 10 hours of material in the same time you would normally shoot your film not edit just the shooting part. You dont get to vivisection it in the same way. Actors playing roles are constantly revealing new strengths to you and weaknesses. Its hard. But one of the lovely things about working in television is that youre meeting all these actors that may have done a lot or a little and you have to rapidly interface with people youve never met.Is workingin that way liberatingYou do a lot of weeping but its also invigorating.I know that with more prep and with more preproduction meetings I can get people to understand what my intentions are. Often with a television show you get one conversation in the hallway by the coffee machine. You may not get an idea exactly where you want it but youre able to move it over to another scene and itll still be part and parcel of the tapestry you just cant get it specific. It wasnt what you intended. So yeah there were things that made me miserable but there were also things that were happy accidents.How is the studio blockbuster sequel business treating you these daysWorld War Z Were trying. A lot of stones have been laid. Were just deconstructing it right now against the mythology that exists to see where we can go.MINDHUNTER is available to stream on Netflix now.Published 12 Nov 2017Share thisTags             David FincherNetflixMost PopularLWLies 101 The Poor Things issue  Out nowAndrew Haigh Im a pretty melancholic personAll of Us Strangers review  a supernova of a filmYorgos Lanthimos Why is sex such a taboo I really dont understandSuggested For YouWith Mindhunter David Finchers killer completes their journeyBy Brogan MorrisNetflixs newest crime drama series is the culmination of a careerlong obsession for the director.articlesHow David Fincher put complex women in the frameBy Simran HansA look beyond the dominant male characters that inhabit the Gone Girl directors cinema.articlesWomen In FilmWhy Zodiac remains David Finchers most puzzling masterpieceBy Tim CookeThe directors truecrime chiller is as tricky and compelling as ever.articlesIn Praise OfSign up to our weekly newsletter ReviewsFeaturesInterviewsPodcastMagazineBecome a MemberDigital EditionsWrite for LWLiesAboutContactAccess InformationPrivacy PolicySubscribe to the LWLies newsletterAbout UsContactWrite for LWLiesThe Scoring SystemPrivacy Policy FacebookTwitterInstagramYouTubeNewsletterOpen search                    What are you looking for                Search Little White LiesReviews AZActors AZDirectors AZAbout Little White LiesLittle White Lies was established in 2005 as a bimonthly print magazine committed to championing great movies and the talented people who make them.
