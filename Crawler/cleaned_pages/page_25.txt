His mother Claire Mae ne Boettcher was a mental health nurse from South Dakota who worked in drug addiction programs. His father Howard Kelly Jack Fincher 19302003 was an author from Oklahoma who worked as a reporter and bureau chief for Life magazine. When Fincher was two years old the family moved to San Anselmo California where he counted filmmaker George Lucas among his neighbors. He became fascinated with filmmaking at the age of eight and began making films on an 8mm camera. In a 2012 interview he saidI was eight years old and I saw a documentary on the making of Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid. It had never occurred to me that movies didnt take place in real time. I knew that they were fake I knew that the people were acting but it had never occurred to me that it could take ... four months to make a movie It showed the entire company with all these rental horses and moving trailers to shoot a scene on top of a train. They would hire somebody who looked like Robert Redford to jump onto the train. It never occurred to me that there were hours between each of these shots. The actual circus of it was invisible as it should be but in seeing that I became obsessed with the idea of How It was the ultimate magic trick. The notion that 24 still photographs are shown in such quick succession that movement is imparted from itwow And I thought that there would never be anything that would be as interesting as that to do with the rest of my life.As a teenager Fincher moved to Ashland Oregon where he attended Ashland High School. He directed plays and designed sets and lighting after school was a nonunion projectionist at Varsity Theatre and worked as a production assistant at the KOBI news station in Medford. He supported himself by working as a busboy dishwasher and fry cook.Careeredit19831991 Early workeditWhile establishing himself in the film industry Fincher was employed at John Kortys studio as a production head. Gaining further experience he became a visual effects producer working on the animated Twice Upon a Time 1983 with George Lucas. He was hired by Industrial Light  Magic ILM in 1983 as an assistant cameraman and matte photographer and worked on Return of the Jedi 1983 and Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom 1984. In 1984 he left ILM to direct a television commercial for the American Cancer Society that depicted a fetus smoking a cigarette.This quickly brought Fincher to the attention of producers in Los Angeles and he was soon given the opportunity to direct Rick Springfields 1985 documentary The Beat of the Live Drum. Set on a directing career Fincher cofounded production company Propaganda Films and started directing commercials and music videos. Other directors such as Michael Bay Antoine Fuqua Michel Gondry Spike Jonze Alex Proyas Paul Rachman Mark Romanek Zack Snyder and Gore Verbinski also honed their skills at Propaganda Films before moving on to feature films.Fincher directed TV commercials for many companies including Levis Converse Nike Pepsi Revlon Sony CocaCola and Chanel although he loathed doing them. Starting in 1984 Fincher began his foray into music videos. He directed videos for various artists including singersongwriters Rick Springfield Don Henley Martha Davis Paula Abdul rock band the Outfield and RB singer Jermaine Stewart. Finchers 1990 music video for Freedom 90 was one of the most successful for George Michael.He directed Michael Jacksons Who Is It Aerosmiths Janies Got A Gun and Billy Idols Cradle of Love. For Madonna he directed the videos for Express Yourself Oh Father Bad Girl and Vogue. The blackandwhite video for Vogue took inspiration from the films of the 1920s and 1930s and has been frequently cited as one of the best videos of all time. Between 1984 and 1993 Fincher was credited as a director for 53 music videos. He referred to the production of music videos as his own film school in which he learned how to work efficiently within a small budget and time frame.19922000 BreakthrougheditIn 1990 20th Century Fox hired Fincher to replace Vincent Ward as the director for the sciencefiction horror Alien 3 1992 his film directorial debut. It was the third installment in the Alien franchise starring Sigourney Weaver. The film was released in May 1992 to a mixed reception from critics and was considered weaker than the preceding films. From the beginning Alien 3 was hampered by studio intervention and several abandoned scripts. Peter Travers of the Rolling Stone called the film bold and haunting despite the struggle of nine writers and studio interference.The film received an Academy Award nomination for Best Visual Effects. Years later Fincher publicly expressed his dismay and subsequently disowned the film. In the book Directors Cut Picturing Hollywood in the 21st Century Fincher blames the producers for their lack of trust in him. In an interview with The Guardian in 2009 he stated No one hated it more than me to this day no one hates it more than me.After this critical disappointment Fincher eschewed reading film scripts or directing another project. He briefly retreated to directing commercials and music videos including the video for the song Love Is Strong by the Rolling Stones in 1994 which won the Grammy Award for Best Music Video. Shortly Fincher decided to make a foray back into film. He read Andrew Kevin Walkers original screenplay for Seven 1995 which had been revised by Jeremiah Chechik the director attached to the project at one point. Fincher expressed no interest in directing the revised version so New Line Cinema agreed to keep the original ending. Starring Brad Pitt Morgan Freeman Gwyneth Paltrow R. Lee Ermey and Kevin Spacey it tells the story of two detectives who attempt to identify a serial killer who bases his murders on the Christian seven deadly sins. Seven was positively received by film critics and was one of the highestearning films of 1995 grossing more than 320million worldwide. Writing for Sight and Sound John Wrathall said it stands as the most complex and disturbing entry in the serial killer genre since Manhunter and Roger Ebert opined that Seven is one of the darkest and most merciless films ever made in the Hollywood mainstream.Following Seven Fincher directed a music video for 6th Avenue Heartache by the Wallflowers and went on to direct his third feature film the mystery thriller The Game 1997 written by the duo John Brancato and Michael Ferris. Fincher also hired Seven screenwriter Andrew Kevin Walker to contribute and polish the script. Filmed on location in San Francisco the story follows an investment banker played by Michael Douglas who receives an unusual gift from his younger brother Sean Penn where he becomes involved in a game that integrates with his everyday life making him unable to differentiate between game and reality. Almar Haflidason of the BBC was critical of the ending but praised the visualsFincher does a marvelous job of turning ordinary city locations into frightening backdrops where every corner turned is another step into the unknown. Upon The Games release in September 1997 the film received generally favorable reviews but performed moderately at the box office. The Game was later included in the Criterion Collection.In August 1997 Fincher agreed to direct Fight Club based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. It was his second film with 20th Century Fox after the troubled production of Alien 3. Starring Brad Pitt Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter the film is about a nameless office worker suffering from insomnia who meets a salesman and together form an underground fighting club as a form of therapy. Fox struggled with the marketing of the film and were concerned that it would have a limited audience. Fight Club premiered on October 15 1999 in the United States to a polarized response and modest box office success the film grossed 100.9 million against a budget of 63 million. Initially many critics thought the film was a violent and dangerous express train of masochism and aggression. However in following years Fight Club became a cult favorite and gained acknowledgement for its multilayered themes the film has been the source of critical analysis from academics and film critics.In 1999 Fincher was shortlisted by Columbia Pictures as one of the potential directors to helm SpiderMan 2002 a liveaction adaptation of the fictional comicbook character of the same name. Finchers pitch featured an older experienced version of the titular character in his adult years and the postadolescent portion of his life as a photographer and his crimefighting double life as a vigilante with a more grounded characterdriven and dramaoriented tone and direction. Fincher later said of his pitch I went in and told them what I might be interested in doing and they hated it. Sam Raimi was chosen as director instead.20012010 Continued successeditJesse Eisenberg and Fincher at the 2010 New York Film Festival.In 2001 Fincher served as an executive producer for the first season of The Hire a series of short films to promote BMW automobiles.

Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle praised the filmmakers for their fair degree of ingenuity... for 88 minutes of excitement and the convincing performance given by Foster. Fincher acknowledged Panic Room for being more mainstream describing the film Its supposed to be a popcorn moviethere are no great overriding implications. Its just about survival.Five years after Panic Room Fincher returned on March 2 2007 with Zodiac a thriller based on Robert Graysmiths books about the search for the Zodiac a real life serial murderer who terrorized communities between the late 1960s and early 1970s. Fincher first learned of the project after being approached by producer Brad Fischer he was intrigued by the story due to his childhood personal experience. The highway patrol had been following our school buses he recalled. His father told him Theres a serial killer who has killed four or five people... whos threatened to... shoot the children as they come off the bus.After extensive research on the case with fellow producers Fincher formed a principal cast of Jake Gyllenhaal Mark Ruffalo Robert Downey Jr. Anthony Edwards and Brian Cox. It was the first of Finchers films to be shot in digital with a Thomson Viper FilmStream HD camera. However highspeed film cameras were used for particular murder scenes. Zodiac was well received appearing in more than two hundred top ten lists only No Country for Old Men and There Will Be Blood appeared in more. However the film struggled at the United States box office earning 33million but did better overseas with a gross of 51.7million. Worldwide Zodiac was a moderate success. Despite a campaign by Paramount Pictures the film did not receive any Academy Award or Golden Globe nominations.In 2008 Fincher was attached to a film adaptation of the sciencefiction novel Rendezvous with Rama by Arthur C.

It began a limited theatrical release in October 2023 and was subsequently released on Netflix on 10 November.Filmmaking style and techniqueseditInfluenceseditFincher did not attend film school. He has listed filmmakers George Roy Hill Alfred Hitchcock Stanley Kubrick Alan J. Pakula Ridley Scott and Martin Scorsese as his major influences. His personal favorite films include Rear Window 1954 Lawrence of Arabia 1962 The Graduate 1967 Paper Moon 1973 American Graffiti 1973 Jaws 1975 All the Presidents Men 1976 Taxi Driver 1976 Close Encounters of the Third Kind 1977 and Zelig 1983. He suggested that his film Panic Room is a combination of Rear Window and Straw Dogs 1971.For Seven Fincher and cinematographer Darius Khondji were inspired by films The French Connection 1971 and Klute 1971 as well as the work of photographer Robert Frank. He has cited graphic designer Saul Bass as an inspiration for his films title sequences Bass designed many such sequences for prominent directors including Hitchcock and Kubrick.MethodeditThose are the moments where moviemaking is not like writing and its not like the theater and its not like performance art and its not like sculpting. Its truly its own discipline. Theres nothing else like it in those moments where you go wow heres an intent that was probably never even thought of by the guy who wrote the book. And yet this person who may or may not have even read the source material has found this thing. That for me after the previsualization is the most exciting part of the whole.Fincher on serendipity during filmmaking.Finchers filmmaking process always begins with extensive research and preparation although he has said the process is different every time I enjoy reading a script that you can see in your head and then I enjoy the casting and I enjoy the rehearsal and I enjoy all the meetings about what it should be what it could be what it might be. He has admitted to having autocratic tendencies and prefers to micromanage every aspect of a films production. Icelandic film producer Sigurjn Sighvatsson with whom Fincher has collaborated for decades has said that Fincher was always a rebel... always challenging the status quo.Known for his perfectionism and meticulous eye for detail Fincher performs thorough research when casting actors to ensure their suitability for the part. His colleague Max Daly said Hes really good at finding the one detail that was missed. He knows more than anybody. Producer Laura Ziskin said of him Hes just scary smart sort of smarter than everyone else in the room. He approaches editing like intricate mathematical problems. Longtime collaborator Angus Wall said that editing Zodiac was like putting together a Swiss watch... all the pieces are so beautifully machined. He elaborated Fincher is incredibly specific. He never settles. And theres a purity that shows in his work.When working with actors Fincher is known to demand a grueling series of takes to capture a scene perfectly. For instance the Zodiac cast members were required to do upwards of 70 takes for certain scenes much to the displeasure of Jake Gyllenhaal. Rooney Mara had to endure 99 takes for a scene in The Social Network and said that Fincher enjoys challenging people. Gone Girl averaged 50 takes per scene. In one of the episodes for Mindhunter it was reported that a nineminute scene took 11 hours to shoot. When asked about this method Fincher said I hate earnestness in performance... usually by take 17 the earnestness is gone. He added that he wants a scene to be as natural and authentic as possible. Some actors appreciate this approach arguing that the subtle adjustments have a big difference in the way a scene is carried. Others have been critical with R. Lee Ermey stating Fincher wants puppets. He doesnt want actors that are creative.Fincher prefers shooting with Red digital cameras under natural or preexisting light conditions rather than using elaborate lighting setups. Fincher is known to use computergenerated imagery which is mostly unnoticeable to the viewer. He does not normally use handheld cameras during filming instead preferring cameras on a tripod. He said Handheld has a powerful psychological stranglehold. It means something specific and I dont want to cloud whats going on with too much meaning. He has experimented with the disembodied camera movement notably in Panic Room where the camera glides around the house to give the impression of surveillance by an unseen observer.Style and themeseditOne element of Finchers visual style is the specific way in which he uses tilt pan and track in the camera movements. When a character is in motion or expressing emotions the camera moves at the exact same speed and direction as their body. The movements are choreographed precisely between the actors and camera operators. The resulting effect helps the audience connect with the character to understand their feelings. Similarly in his music videos Fincher appreciated that the visuals should enhance the listening experience. He would cut around the vocals and let the choreography finish before cutting the shot. Camera movements are synchronized to the beat of the music.Some regard Fincher as an auteur filmmaker although he dislikes being associated with that term. Much of his work is influenced by classical film noir and neo noir genres. Finchers visual style also includes using monochromatic and desaturated colors of blue green and yellow representing the world that the characters are in. In The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Fincher uses heavy desaturation for certain scenes and increases or decreases the effect based on the story or characters emotions. Erik Messerschmidt cinematographer for Mindhunter explained the color palette The show has a desaturated greenyellow look... it helps give the show its period feel. He states the effect is achieved through production design costumes and filming locationsnot necessarily through lighting used on set. Fincher also favors detailed and pronounced shadows as well as using minimal light. When asked about his use of dim lighting he said bright lights make the color of skin appear unnatural and that the lights and colors in his films represent the way the world looks to him.Fincher has explored themes of martyrdom alienation and dehumanization of modern culture. In addition to the wider themes of good and evil his characters are usually troubled discontented and flawed they are often unable to socialize and suffer from loneliness. In Seven Zodiac and The Social Network themes of pressure and obsession are explored leading to the characters downfall. Quoting historian Frank Krutnik the writer Piers McCarthy argues that the protagonists of these films are not totally in control of their actions but are subject to darker inner impulses.In a 2017 interview Fincher explained his fascination of sinister themes There was always a house in any neighborhood that I ever lived in that all the kids on the street wondered What are those people up to We sort of attach the sinister to the mundane in order to make things interesting... I think its also because in order for something to be evil it almost has to cloak itself as something else. Fincher once stated I think people are perverts. Ive maintained that. Thats the foundation of my career.CollaboratorseditFrequent Fincher collaborators Trent Reznor and Atticus RossOver the course of his career Fincher has shown loyalty to many members of his cast and crew. As a music video director he collaborated with Paula Abdul five times as well as Madonna and Rick Springfield four times each. Once he made the transition to feature films he cast Brad Pitt in three of them. He said of Pitt Onscreen and offscreen Brads the ultimate guy... he has such a great ease with who he is. Bob Stephenson Michael Massee Christopher John Fields John Getz Elias Koteas Zach Grenier Charles Dance Rooney Mara Jared Leto and Richmond Arquette have also appeared in at least two of his films.Fight Club was scored by the Dust Brothers who at that point had never scored a film. Describing their working relationship with Fincher they said he was not hanging over our shoulders telling us what to do and that the only direction he gave was to make the music sound as great as the score from The Graduate 1967. Nine Inch Nails members Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross composed the music for The Social Network The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo Gone Girl Mank and The Killer. The musicians describe their working relationship as collaborative respectful and inspiring although quipped that it hasnt gotten any easier. Many years before the duo worked with Fincher he arranged for a remix of the Nine Inch Nails song Closer to play over the opening credits of Seven. Howard Shore composed the scores for Seven The Game and Panic Room.Darius Khondji and Jeff Cronenweth have served as cinematographers for Finchers films. Khondji said Fincher deserves a lot of credit. It was his influence that pushed me to experiment and got me as far as I did. Fincher has hired sound designer Ren Klyce in all his films since 1995 and trusts him implicitly. He has worked with film editor Angus Wall since 1988. Wall has worked on seven of his films five of which as editor.Donald Graham Burt has served as a production designer for six films and Bob Wagner has served as an assistant director for six. Casting director Laray Mayfield has worked with Fincher for over 20 years. In a 2010 interview Fincher said You dont have to love all of your cocollaborators but you do have to respect them. And when you do when you realize that people bring stuff to the table thats not necessarily your experience but if you allow yourself to relate to it it can enrich the buffet that youre going to bring with you into the editing room.Personal lifeeditFincher married model Donya Fiorentino sister of actress Linda Fiorentino.
