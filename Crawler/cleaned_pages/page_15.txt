Merrick Morton  NetflixDavid Fincher Is Still Fascinated By Serial KillersThe director of Seven returns to familiar material with his new Netflix series Mindhunter.Adam Grant											Oct 13 2017					The first rule of interviewing David Fincher Dont talk about Fight Club. He directed that movie along with Seven Gone Girl Zodiac The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and The Social Network. Hes also an executive producer of House of Cards. One of the most meticulous creators in film and television returns to familiar territory on October 13 with Mindhunter a Netflix drama about how the FBI first developed techniques to catch serial killers and rapists.Adam Grant Whats the best piece of career advice youve ever received David Fincher Joel Schumacher who I consider to be one of the wisest people Ive ever met once told me a great thing You have to be very careful not to become the only person who cares because then they have you. You have to be prepared at any moment to say You guys seem like you have it all under control and you have a very clear idea about what it is that you want. Why dont you just do that Why do you need me to be involved The only way youre ever going to be in control of what it is that youre doing is to be prepared to not be involved.I look at directors who say Well I just have to do something. I havent done a movie in two years. Im like Really You have to do something I feel like you shouldnt do somethingyou should do the thing. You should be ready to go to the mat for it. You should be ready to say This is the way that this should be done. So dont care too much. Thats an unfair paraphrasing but what Joel meant was you have to somehow impart how much you care about stuff to a number of other people and get them to care. You cant think of it in terms of what youre going to get out of it. You have to think of it in terms of planned obsolescence. Ill never be finished with it at some point itll be finished with me.I feel like you shouldnt do somethingyou should do the thing.Youre rumored to be perfectionistic in reshooting scenes. Is that true How do you know when creative work is done Thats a lot of bullshit. Among the lazy I would be considered a perfectionist. I have scenes in many of the movies or television that Ive made where its simply you missed it you didnt get it and you have to kind of then rethink it and go Where does the best material take us I just dont believe in cutting a sequence based on Well this guy wasnt having a good day so were going to play off him onto somebody else. Thats unfair to the actor and unfair to the audience. I feel like its my job to let the structure of the images be decided by what the story needs as opposed to what the performances will allow. Were playing dressupits not like youre asking someone to go through openheart surgery again.I think that cinema is hopefully a kind of creative Darwinism and the best ideas prevail. Part of my job as director is to put blinders on people and youre trying to put blinders on yourself so that you dont get bogged down in minutiae that no one will ever experience or will ever accrue to a greater value of understanding or appreciation of the final product. But you also have to leave yourself open enough that when something happens that should be a part of your story you dont steamroll it looking at the schedule or looking at the sun.NetflixYou seem to be drawn to these people who live very dark lives or have very dark things that go on in their minds. Seven is sort of gloriously absurd in the canon of the criminal masterminds. Its interesting to me I dont know if its interesting to anyone else. There was always a house in any neighborhood that I ever lived in that all the kids on the street wondered What are those people up to We sort of attach the sinister to the mundane in order to make things interesting. I think that theres a tendency for the human mind to work that way. I think its also because in order for something to be evil it almost has to cloak itself as something else.What are you hoping to do to your audiences Is the goal to make people terrified that everyone they meet might be a serial killerListen should we help people look for their lost animals Probably. Should third graders help strangers look for lost animals Not in this day and age. I would hope that as human beings we would make ourselves available to helping people who are in need. But the reason these predators continue to fascinate us is that we want to write this behavior off as madness. Yet to be a serial killer you have to kill at least three peoplewhich means you have to not get caught with the first two. For that to happen you have to be fairly thoughtful in premeditation. Its the hiding in plain sight. Thats the thing that I find terrifying about them.What have you learned about the minds of profilersThe Silence of the Lambs was an incredible recruiting tool for the FBI. They were asking me Is Mindhunter going to be like Silence of the Lambs No. Investigators are criminal masterminds in a certain way but very sad. When you engage with this kind of inhumanity it comes at a cost. We gift them with these superpowers but really they are just very thoughtful hunters. They have to imagine every permutation. What if the killer does this What if the victim does this They have to work this stuff out in advance. Its not Anthony Hopkins its not a gourmet chef sommelier and chess master. These killers are abused confused and evil people. This show is much more about following the trail of inhumanity.Investigators are criminal masterminds in a certain way but very sad. When you engage with this kind of inhumanity it comes at a cost.If you could go into any writers room and be a fly on the wall where would you goId probably go to The Sopranos Season Five or Six. I would like to watch David Chase work. It seems like a very complete world in somebodys head. And then maybe Deadwood Season One. At one point I was two millimeters from saying yes to directing the pilot and part of it was I was just so fascinated with David Milch. Milch and Chase are masterful. They both have a great ear as to how things can be presented or how you can get things out of characters. I think thats an odd gift and it intrigues me.NetflixYoure working on your fourth film with Brad Pitt. Whats the secret of that connectionThe gift of that relationship that keeps on giving is that we have a very similar appreciation of the great cosmic joke. Its like we dont even need words. Youve reached a point where you just like gibberish and you can kind of communicate in guttural utterances.A film is a standalone creative product a show is an ongoing story. How would you contrast directing in those two worldsIn movies theres almost no room for characterization anymore and in television theres no money for plot. The monetary constraints in television tend to make most of your entertainment value about characterization. The antithesis is true in movies because no ones interested in anyones backstory or how conflicted they are but in what theyre doing or whether or not something resonates with them. Youre there to thwart the destruction of the world. On a movie set youre the general people work for the director. In television you work for the show and you may not ever meet this director again. Theres a tendency to see the director as a migrant worker. These arent longterm relationships. The urgency is differenttheres no navelgazing.In TV with so little time for management by walking around let alone actually getting to know people how do you build relationships with your teamI pride myself on being half an hour early and leaving half an hour after everyone else and I make myself available to answer any questions.
