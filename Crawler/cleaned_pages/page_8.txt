Please read our Legal Terms  PoliciesAAAEmailThere was a time when David Finchers career threatened to derail. Following his 2002 homeinvasion thriller Panic Room he dropped out of skateboard film Lords of Dogtown and Tom Cruise vehicle Mission Impossible III. He toyed with numerous other projects  including an adaptation of Arthur C Clarkes Rendezvous With Rama  but nothing came to fruition. Making movies is hard he shrugs. It takes a long time. Already known for his Kubricklike fastidiousness Fincher seemed afraid to commit to anything less than the perfect project.Still Fincher knows more than most that patience is a virtue. Arriving just 18 months after Zodiac his meticulous 2007 truelife serialkiller tale that finally returned him to directing comes The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. A nighon threehour epic meditation on life death and all the bits in between and all of a sudden Fincher is looking prolific. I know he grins when we meet in Berlin. And I have nothing new to sayYet with Benjamin Button marking a significant new chapter in his career this couldnt be further from the truth. No longer the punk provocateur Fincher has grown up with a film about growing young.The film has already grossed more than 100m in the USbecoming Finchers most commercially successful film to date eclipsing his previous personal best set by 1995s Se7en. Better still this sensually made adaptation of F Scott Fitzgeralds short story about a man who is born old and ages backwards has been embraced by the industry. It leads the pack at this years Oscars with 13 nominations including Best Picture and Best Director a prize Fincher is also up for at next Sundays Baftas  the first time hes even been nominated for either award.Having lost out at the Golden Globes when Benjamin Button didnt score with one of its five nominations Fincher seems unmoved by such backslapping. Its a great thing to make movies he says. Awards are just icing on the cake. Perhaps hes all too aware of just how fickle Hollywood is. So hellish was his time battling with executives on his 1992 debut Alien 3 he famously stated that hed rather get colon cancer than make another studio movie. Then there was the critical roasting he got over 1999s Fight Club his nihilistic examination of millennial angst the late Evening Standard critic Alexander Walker claimed it was antiGod.This time its hardcore Fincher fans who might feel outraged as the director goes touchyfeely. Beginning at the end of the First World War its a whimsical slice of magic realism as its protagonist played by Brad Pitt is born with the body of an octogenarian and grows younger by the day.Though technically groundbreaking with Pitts facial features grafted on to a body double in these early scenes its a far cry from the grim aesthetic and grisly themes of Se7en Fight Club and Zodiac. Fincher remains unapologetic I dont mind an experience thats emotional if it sneaks up on you. I just dont like it when it announces itself when you see it coming from the first act.The script landed on Finchers desk as far back as 1992 and unlike all the others that have fallen by the wayside it was one he couldnt let go. I read it and it made me cry. I recognised so many of the people in the movie I thought It would be nice to make this movie. Nice This coming from the man who put Gwyneth Paltrows head in a box in Se7en brutalised Jared Letos face in Fight Club and terrorised Jodie Foster in Panic Room Detractors are already sharpening their knives the BBCs Mark Kermode recently sniffing that the film was Forrest Gump with Alevels a reference to the fact that it was cowritten by Gump scribe Eric Roth.Yet this fails to take into account the profoundly tragic dimension of Benjamins dilemma as he falls for Daisy Cate Blanchett a young ballerina he meets when hes a wizened old man. Eventually as he ages backwards and she forwards they pass each other in years and fall under each others spell. Would you still love me if I were old and saggy she asks. Would you still love me if I were young and had acne he replies. Still their problems are much more than cosmetic as the ageing Daisy must contend with a lover approaching adolescence in reverse. As Fincher puts it There isnt a happily ever after.Now 46 his hair and goatee a delicate shade of grey Fincher admits that notions of mortality were swirling through his mind when he first read Roths script. He was reminded of his father Jack Fincher a former Life magazine reporter who died five years ago. I remember the experience of being there when he breathed his last breath he says. It was incredibly profound. When you lose someone who helped form you in lots of ways who is your true north you lose the barometer of your life. Youre no longer trying to please someone or youre no longer reacting against something. In many ways youre truly alone.Not that he is entirely. Hes now with CeChaffin who has produced every film hes made since his 1997 sophomore effort The Game. He also has one 14yearold daughter Phelix Imogen from his fiveyear marriage to model Donya Fiorentino which ended in 1995. Born in Denver Colorado Fincher was raised in California and moved to Oregon in his teens by which point he was already showing signs of his huge talent. In highschool he was producing a local television news show. By 19 he had a job working for George Lucass company Industrial Light and Magic helping create visual effects for 1983s Star Wars episode Return of the Jedi.If that sounds commercial his early work in music videos and ad spots was just as mainstream. Nike and Pepsi Madonna and Michael Jackson all got the Fincher treatment. He helped form promo outfit Propaganda Films a breeding ground for a certain type of brashandflash director. In 1998 the nowdefunct Premiere magazine ran a shot of Fincher with fellow Propaganda employees asking Do these men represent the future of Hollywood filmmaking  or the death of it Pictured with Simon West Tomb Raider Dominic Sena Gone in Sixty Seconds and Michael Bay Pearl Harbor Fincher looked guilty by association.Today dressed in a grey striped shirt and greyandblack check jacket looking more accountant than auteur Fincher is no longer the cocky promo director  if he ever was. Quietly spoken and highly articulate he may come across as rather cold in person but theres something mischievous about him. Its fun to be that misunderstood he says.While Fincher is next planning a biopic of Al Capones nemesis Eliot Ness which will no doubt make the fans breathe easier he claims Benjamin Button is perfectly in keeping with the pattern of his career. I look forward to doing things I havent done before. Im contrary by nature. As soon as somebody tells me it cant be done Im like Why do you say thatEven after the success of Benjamin Button he retains a healthy disrespect for the industry. The opening weekend has never been of interest to me he says. Yes its very satisfying to have movies that open to giant boxoffice numbers in the dickmeasuring contest that is Hollywood. Its a nice thing that you know that this movie is going to be an enormous profit machine. But look at Wizard of Oz  that tanked when it opened and its worth a billion dollars. Citizen Kane almost didnt open due to the influential William Randolph Hearsts dislike of the subject matter. Im not saying my movies are on that classic level but hopefully thats what youre trying to do. Still if it sweeps the Oscars next month its place in cinema history is assured.The Curious Case of Benjamin Button 12A opens on FridayTopsy turvy More stories in which time runs backwardsI Havent Dreamed of Flying For a While 2008Mutsuko is 67 when businessman Taura meets her.
