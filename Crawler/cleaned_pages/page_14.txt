Follow him on Twitter DarrenFranich for opinions and recommendations.EWs editorial guidelinesPublished on October 3 2014Trending Videos01of 14   The Master Plan and the Master Planner  Theres a character type that runs through David Finchers work. Call it the Architect The personor group or sometimes even just an intangible forcethat sits at the center of the story often shrouded in mystery often playing an elaborate chess game with the lead characters as pawns. Kevin Spacey in Seven is one of the great chessmaster serial killers wrapping the detectives played by Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt in his murderous tapestry. Many years later Spaceys headlining role as political mastermind Frank Underwood in the Finchercreated House of Cards is basically Mr. Doe Goes to WashingtonIn The Game Michael Douglas finds himself trapped in a paranoid world where everyone really is out to get him. The nightmare architecture of The Game gets repeated in the final act of Fight Club as Edward Nortons nameless narrator struggles against the omnipresent practically omniscient Project Mayhem. The Girl With the Dragon Tattoos ultimate nemesis is a more straightforward soliloquizingserialkiller archetype than John Doebut you could argue that the Architect of Dragon Tattoo is actually Lisbeth Salander who embarks on a very Tyler Durdenesque mission of mayhem computer hacking wiping bank accounts taking on The System in the films final act.You can understand why Fincher reacted to Gillian Flynns Gone Girl a book that shifts perspective between brutish husband Nick and missing wife Amy constructing a fearful symmetry of halftruths even before the storys major twists kick in. The mystery at the core of Gone Girl feels equivalent to the demonic antagonist of Finchers masterpiece Zodiac. The genius of Zodiac is how it constantly teases you with the presence of an Architect only to pull the rug outsometimes a scary man in a basement is just a scary man in a basement. Zodiac is sort of like The Game without the thirdact reveal The movies central horror is that there might not be a master plan after all.02of 14   Serial Killers  The Silence of the Lambs kickstarted the serial killer vogue but Seven defined the genre. John Does decision to base all his murders on the Seven Deadly Sins launched a million elevatorpitch murder plotlines. Murders based on Edgar Allen Poe Murders based on urban legends Fincher returned to the genre and in many ways deconstructed it with Zodiac. And The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo imagines a serial killer who likes to do his nasty business while listening to Enya. Why the obsession with mass murderersFincher likes to shroud his killers in mystery. Usually he literally shrouds them John Doe first appears in Seven as a shadowy outoffocus figure as subtle as a Dick Tracy villain. Hes a distant cousin of Raoul the home invader who lingers around the margins of Panic Room before his deeper madness is revealed. For Fincher there is something profoundly unknowable about serial killersand something magnificent which is why John Doe gets the last word in Seven.03of 14   Loneliness  Because Seven starred Brad Pitt at his youngpretty mid90s peak its easy to forget that the film really belongs to Morgan Freeman. Hes our initial viewpoint character and we see Pitts younghotshot cop through Freemans amusedmentor perspective. And whats striking about Freemans Somerset is just how lonely he is A man living in a quiet house he seems uncomfortable walking into the domestic sphere where Pitts Mills and his wife Tracy Gwyneth Paltrow are trying to make a home. Later in the movie we learn that Somerset was in love long ago then the girl got pregnant and Somerset askeddemanded that she get an abortion.This revelation comes in a casual diner scene where Tracy reveals to Somerset that she is considering having an abortion. Its not one of Sevens most famous scenes but its a remarkable standout in Finchers filmography Somersets whole central idea that it might be better not to have children is exemplary of a certain instinct towards loneliness that runs throughout Finchers work. Michael Douglas in The Game is a lonely rich man in a lonely rich house. Edward Norton in Fight Club is a lonely whitecollar businessman sleepwalking through his IKEA apartment. In Panic Room we meet Jodie Foster fresh from her divorceand her big new apartment feels epidemic of the confused emptiness at the end of a long relationship.In Finchers later work the drive toward loneliness becomes an explicit character trait. Jake Gyllenhaal in Zodiac lets his obsession with the case ruin his marriage Mark Zuckerberg in The Social Network becomes impossibly successful only after he sheds his closest friends. Slightly more positive is the weird final act of The Curious Case of Benjamin Button wherein Brad Pitts backwardsaging Benjamin spends the later decades of his life away from his family basically walking the earth like Caine in Kung Fu.04of 14   Digital Effects Invading the Real World  Every director uses digital effects today usually to create fantasy worlds or uncanny action scenes. But Fincher was one of the first directors to use digital effects as a way to explore and defamiliarize the recognizable real world. Fight Clubs camera moves through the trash in Edward Nortons deskand the only sex scene in the movie was filmed using the bullet time technique from The Matrix transforming the actors nude bodies into ethereal abstractions. Fincher pushed the innovations of Fight Club into nearparody in the overly excitable Panic Room where the camera swoops through household objects and doorframes.A couple years after Fincher made Panic Room his particular fascination with digitalreality reached a peak with the music video for Nine Inch Nails Only wherein normal objects on a normal desk start coming to CGIassisted life. And one way to understand the semiinexplicable Benjamin Button is to imagine the movie as a laboratory for Fincher experimenting with performancecapture effects to create Brad Pitts ancient toddler. Finchers digital addition has gotten less showy in his recent work but it hasnt gone away The director will often combine multiple takes into a single shot using digital composition which is what can make his films look eerily beautiful or sometimes just weirdly plastic.05of 14   Darkness and a Single Light  Part of what makes Fincher such a fun subject of study is that he doesnt have an obvious visualtrope toolkit No Abramsy lens flares no Wes Andersonian Xaxis no Spielbergian lookingintothesky. But Finchers films do have a vivid constant look Draped in darkness and shadow with a single color pervading or even dominating the frame. Panic Room is a showcase for this side of Fincher A film set almost entirely at night in a house with the lights off. The Social Network could be seen as an unlikely entry in Finchers worknobody diesbut part of the movies central frisson is how Fincher shoots everything like a thriller bathing nerdy Jesse Eisenberg in noirdark lights like hes the second coming of Harry Lime.06of 14   Obsession  When people talk about Fincher they usually talk about his style The antiseptic light falling on androidal skin the magazinead compositions. Its possible to accuse Fincher of being completely invested in style over substance An accusation that gains weight when you consider a movie like The Curious Case of Benjamin Button a gorgeously composed adventure that never really goes anywhere.So what is Fincher all about exactly The most common consensus is Obsession. His Architect characters are obsessed with their own elaborate plotting. Fincher himself is a famously meticulous demiKubrick insisting on dozens or hundreds of takes. This is why Zodiac feels like Finchers most personal workthe central characters all become obsessed with the title character until their lives are consumed by their own obsession.07of 14   The Passage of Time  Or maybe The Curious Case of Benjamin Button isnt an outlier maybe its part of the key to understanding Finchers deeper themes. Benjamin Button hyperbolizes an F. Scott Fitzgerald short satire into a fantasy of a mans life As Benjamin gets younger we see him lose his parents take a lover have a child.Maybe what scares and fascinates Fincher the most is the simple passage of time. Two of his most wellknown commercials take a panoramic view of time The lives of two football players and the history of Earth basically. Time is the ultimate nemesis in Zodiac a movie that begins with the structure of a mysterythriller and then becomes scarier as it becomes chronological the years passing before the graying protagonists eyes. The shockcut of time is the central narrative structure of The Social Networkwe witness Zuckerbergs rise from the perspective of two rotating lawsuits and his best friend becoming a bitter enemy back and forth through time.08of 14   Modern Noir  Then again maybe its simpler to look at Fincher as our preeminent practitioner of noiralbeit uniquely modern noir where half of the mystery is figuring out what kind of mystery is being solved. Fight Club gets remembered today for the big Tshirtworthy speeches but the film is also a meticulously crafted mystery. Coming out in theaters just a couple months after The Sixth Sense Fight Club has a finalact twist thats every bit as wildand if anything the twist in Finchers film is more convincing insofar as there are clues spread throughout almost every scene. And in Gone Girl the central mystery is constructed on a 3D chessboard where its hard to even say what crime has been committed much less who committed it.09of 14   Brad Pitt  Finchers most consistent onscreen collaborator Pitt received one of his first truly great star showcases in Seven. The way Fincher uses Pitt in the movie is telling At a time when most filmmakers were playing off the actors goldengod good looks Fincher beats him to a pulp midway through. And thats just a prelude for the final devastating gut punch. Fincher doubled down on that abuse in Fight Club transforming Pitt into a new kind of masochist superman.Pitts presence is part of the central weirdness of Fight Club. When Tyler Durden points at a Calvin Klein ad for a skimpy manthong and asks Is that what a man looks like its hard to forget that Pitt basically was that guy in his original showcase Thelma  Louisenot to mention the fact that Finchers camera lingers obsessively on Pitts ridiculously cut body. Theres something equally weird at work in Benjamin Buttononly Fincher would cast Brad Pitt in a movie and make him look like a cartoonbaby Donald Rumsfeld for the first half hour. By far their most lighthearted collaboration was a Heineken commercial that ran during the 2005 Super Bowl.10of 14   Trent Reznor  Finchers relationship with the Nine Inch Nails frontman began with the opening credits sequence of Seven although their first proper collaboration was the music video for Only. That was just prelude Reznor and Atticus Ross have become Finchers goto soundtrackers composing the Oscarwinning score for The Social Network and providing the moody tones for Dragon Tattoo and Gone Girl.11of 14   OldWorld Glamour  Because Finchers filmography is so tied into a certain scuzzychic sensibilitysteam flowing out of pipes the bleak dystopiGotham of Sevenits worth remembering that Fincher may have a retro even romantic heart. His video for Madonnas Vogue all the dreamy dancing scenes in Benjamin Button the jazzgloss of Suit and Tie It all speaks to an uppercrust sensibility the kind of stuff that Tyler Durden would want to explode.12of 14   Science Fiction For the Modern Age  Fincher has come close to making big action movies. At one point he was onboard to helm Mission Impossible 3 hes also been circling an adaptation of Twenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea and certainly its easy to see how an obsessive Architecttype like Captain Nemo would fit into Finchers filmography.Yet Fincher is rather unique among modern bigname directors in that he hasnt ever made a straightup scifi flick. Theres one exception Alien 3 a film that Fincher has essentially disowned and which is mostly interesting for anyone who wants to see a master director in his infancy achieving mildly interesting things along the margins of mediocrity.But Alien 3 does feel in step with much of Finchers workand I think its because so much of Finchers work takes a fantastical genreinflected look at the real world. Many of the early scenes of Fight Club suggest a real world invaded by outside forcesEdward Nortons apartment isnt just an apartment its an advertisement for IKEA. Zodiac prequelizes that sensibility presenting the early 70s as a time when the rise of mass media conjured up a strange new power. A prank caller could be a terrorist a single killer could hold a city hostage. And The Social Network locks into the central fascination of the Internet age How a simple idea can become a societyaltering experience and in the process rapidly age excitable young college kids into emotionless bigbusiness tycoons. Theres an angle on The Social Network where it almost feels like Peanuts chronicling a group of children squabbling while adult authority figures bleat helplessly in the background.13of 14   Men Who Destroy Themselves  Or maybe its simpler to approach Fincher as the chic nihilist that so many of his films proclaim him to be. Suicide runs throughout his work. John Does final act attempts to transform the murderer into his own victim. Fight Clubs loopy premise turns the lead characters internal struggle into an external battle with his own darkest self. The Game can be seen as an elaborate act of suicide preventionalthough that only becomes clear that Michael Douglas tries to commit suicide.His fall off a building resembles Ripleys fall in Alien 3 although her action is more complicated and more openly heroic. Because if Fincher likes men who fight themselves he also likes...14of 14   Women Who Fight Back  Fincher doesnt like Alien 3 but it makes sense that his first big break came in the Alien franchise. Sigourney Weavers Ripley is one of the great action heroines fighting back against the xenomorphic menace. Alien 3 takes the rape allegory at the center of all the movies and specifically applies it to Ripley as she carries an alien baby she doesnt want the whole movie is structured in a sense as her vengeance on the manthing that wronged her.Female vengeance is the centerpiece of Panic Room wherein a jilted housewife fights back against the men invading her house. Its the central underlying factor of the showcase scene of The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo a movie that explicitly casts Rooney Mara as a vengeful superhero for wronged women everywhere. And Gone Girl might be the high point in Finchers feministic filmographyall the more because of how the film complicates our perspective on the title character.Related ArticlesMichael Fassbender slays in teaser for David Finchers The KillerWhy Sevenstill has one of the most shocking endings in cinematic historyEvery David Fincher movie ranked by EW gradeThe 12 best Brad Pitt moviesDavid Fincher How the years real best director became a bornagain filmmakerThe Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonHow David Fincher made ZodiacFrom the EW archives The blood sweat and fears of Fight ClubGone GirlTrent Reznor on the Gone Girl music working with David Fincher and translating David LynchHoliday preview The Girl With the Dragon TattooPopWatch Confessional The thing you hate that everyone else loves25 Greatest Active Film DirectorsBrad Pitt The EW interviewAre Matt Damon and Paul Greengrass the top actordirector pairingFall Movie Preview DecemberEntertainment WeeklyNewsletterFollow Us            TVMoviesMusicWhat To WatchBingeCelebrityThe AwardistBooksTheaterAbout UsTerms of ServiceSubscribeAdvertiseDiversity  Inclusion PledgeCareersPrivacy PolicyYour Privacy ChoicesEntertainment Weekly is part of the Dotdash Meredith publishingfamily.Please review our updated Terms of Service.Newsletter Sign UpNewsletter Sign UpBy clicking Accept All Cookies you agree to the storing of cookies on your device to enhance site navigation analyze site usage and assist in our marketing efforts.
