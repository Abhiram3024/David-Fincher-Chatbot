Finchers directing chops are never in question and Gillian Flynns novel is perhaps perfectly suited for his particular skill set. Gone Girl combines his instinctual way around pitchblack thrillers Se7en Zodiac The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo and offbeat grimy comedies Fight Club and delivers 148 compelling minutes without any evident lull. 	While Fincher and Flynn deserve a ton of credit there were plenty of people who helped bring Flynns2012 best seller to crackling life. Four of these individuals arelongtime collaborators of his cinematographer Jeff Cronenworth his sixth Fincher film production designer Donald Graham Burt five previous collaborations and composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross their third collaboration. Through these collaborators well take a quick spoilerladen look athow they helped Fincher and Flynn find their cinematicGone Girl.	Again folksspoilers below. Menacing McMansions	Production designer Donald Graham Burt deserves a ton of credit for helping Fincher turnNicks hometown of Carthage Missouri into a placeof surface comforts and deep troubles. Burt won an Oscar for Art Direction for his work on The Curious Case of Benjamin Button with Fincher and while his work here is more subtle audiences will react to the world of confining comfort he has helped craft around Nick Ben Affleck and Amy Dunne Rosamund Pike.	The film was shot in Cape Girardeau a Missouri river town a little more than 100 miles outside of St. Louis. Nick and Amys life in Carthage is superficially perfect  two attractive people living in a big house in a nice part of town  but the true picture is one of debt increasing desperation and isolation. Cape Girardeau gave Burt a mixture of pretty McMansions and leafy suburbs lower income areas abandoned storefronts and a hodgepodge of architectural designs. Everything about Cape Girardeau was right Burt said in the press notes. From its mix of different levels of economics and period architectures from the 60s 70s and 80s to its sprawling malls to having the river there as an anchor.	The most important location of all was the Dunne household a large place where Nick and Amy could share a home but remained apart something not too ostentatiously huge and vulgar but one that upon closer inspection seems to be falling apart. The house they settled on had elements like the wood that seemed of a piece with the beautiful New York brownstone they had to give up but in a skewed way Burt said. Its as if the house yearns to be traditionalbut the hardware and the light fixtures and the vinyl windows give it away.	The house itself is schizophrenic a place with large rooms a beautifully appointed bedroom a fetching all glass showeryet nothing that happens in these spaces matches the rich reasonable suburban milieu. From the moment Nick comes home to the broken glass coffee table and signs of a struggle and no Amy the Dunne household slowly begins to reveal itself as the place where everything came unraveled a large superficially beautiful insane asylum. Favorite Spoilery Moment in the Dunne HouseholdThe bloody shower that Amy and Nick take togethera sort of reversePsychothat leaves Nick sputtering in confusion at his wifes lunacy.There was something so unsettling about such a creepy moment in such a Bed Bath  Beyondlike bathroom. The Sound of a Massage Going Horribly Horribly Awry	Having honed their process with Fincher over The Social Network and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo composers Trent Reznor and Atticus Ross happily cop to a method that takes much much longer than what would be usual but which bears such wonderfully strange and potent sounds. Starting on the score long before they see a single reel of the film an unusual way to work for a composer the two musicians continuously hone their work as Fincher and his team stitch the film together. We work almost subconsciously based often just on textures and swatches Reznor said in the production notes. After a few weeks of working this way well turn in some music to see if what we are doing is resonating with whats in Davids head. It probably takes about 30 times as long to work in this way but its what feels right.	The score feels very right perfect in fact and cements the FincherReznorRoss collaboration as one of modern cinemas most exciting directorcomposer collaborations along with Paul Thomas Anderson and Jonny Greenwood and youll get to know them better in the coming months and years Damien Chazelle and Justin Hurwitz.	Fincher told The Wall Street Journal that he got an idea for the score while getting his back adjusted at a spa I was listening to that calming placating music and thought We need to tap into this. The movie is about the faade of the good neighbor the good Christian the good wife. Reznor said that this massage table music idea was the kick off point for the score. We thought what if we start with something that is almost grotesquely sweet and then reveal whats under the surface. We incorporated spalike moments but then explored how to make them turn unpleasant to peel off the layers so you feel the unraveling.	Reznor and Ross known for their virtuosity downscaled their typically robust synthetic soundscape to create something more organic using homemade equipment. At one point you hear an odd tapping sound that is almost like a heart beating a little Edgar Allen Poe The TellTale Heartstyle. It is just Reznor tapping on a wooden box.	The soundtrack starts off sweet and gentle but as Nick Dunnes life unravels the dark hints evident even in those early peacefulseeming sounds begin to grow. By the films end we are well below the surface of placid Suburban Missouri and the facile sweetness of thoseearly songs. Now were wriggling around in a sonic landscape as twisting and unpredictable as Amy Dunne herself.	If you want to listen to Trent Reznor and Atticus Rosss entire soundtrack for Gone Girl click here. The Eye of the Beholder	A ramshackle abandoned mansion in a rat infested industrial zone outside of a city. A storied Ivy league campus turned into twisted playground for a gifted troubled genius. A spotless impeccably designed mansion sitting atop a basement of horrors. Cinematographer Jeff Cronenworth has gone with David Fincher in so many memorably dark directions from Fight Club to The Social Network to The Girl With the Dragon Tattoothat its no surprise he was able to turn a quaint Missouri town into a place seething with secrets and fraying at the edges.	Described as a noir Americana and inspired by the photography of Joel Sternfeld who most famous photographic work American Prospects included color photos of barren landscapes and ruined towns Cronenworth used his considerable skills to turn the American Midwest into a place of hidden dark dimensions.	You look for ways to take a traditional mundane small town and a couples interpersonal home and subtly transform them into something mysterious Cronenworth said. He went on to describe Carthage as a dusty old wedding gown thats been kept in the closet.	One of the ways Cronenworth made the Dunnes home a discomfiting place was through light. The Dunnes house was all about taking a normal ordinary domestic situation and turning it into an isolated fortress with the blinds drawn down. From small details comes that sense of disenchantment. Another was by shooting many scenes from slightly below eyelevel catching a snatch of the ceiling above Nicks head to make him feel caged in his predicament.	To pick justonespoilerystandout moment among many theres theone and only gory scene in the entire film which begins with Amy treating Desi Neil Patrick Harris to some rough sex and ends with the incredible shot of her straddling him covered in his blood. WIll she start weeping at what shes done Nope just a flick of the head to get her her hair out of her eyes.MostPopularJanuary 29 2024Two New Dune Part Two Teasers Arrive as Tickets Go on SaleFebruary 2 2024Brad Pitt Nearing Role in Quentin Tarantinos Next Film The Movie CriticJanuary 25 2024Road House Trailer Reveals Jake Gyllenhaal vs Conor McGregor in Ferocious RemakeABOUT THE AUTHORBryan AbramsBryan Abrams is the Editorinchief of The Credits.Hesrun thesite since itslaunch in 2012.
