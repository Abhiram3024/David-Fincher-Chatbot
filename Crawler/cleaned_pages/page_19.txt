This in itself wasnt especially surprising as Finchers productions seem to attract crises of the cosmicjoke variety be they midshoot injuries Se7en lastminute casting switcheroos Panic Room or onthefly script rewrites Alien3. Despite the directors meticulous planninghe can spend years preparing for a filmsomething usually goes awry. Hes used to it. All movies are a trial he says matteroffactly. Its war.But this latest battle was unique. In a roundabout way it had to do with ABBA.For much of the past year Fincher has been filming The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo his roughly 100 million adaptation of the macabre Swedish mystery that centers on a punkhacker heroine with distinctive skin art. On one of the first nights of shooting Fincher and his crew were in Sweden filming a murder scene that takes place alongside a gloomy dock. But after a nights work Fincher didnt have the shot he wanted and the films ultratight schedule meant he wouldnt be able to return for months.When Fincher began planning the reshoot he learned that the property had been sold to one of the guys in ABBA. Apparently the new ownereither Benny or Bjrn its not really clearwasnt thrilled at the prospect of having his evening stroll interrupted by a simulated drowning and he refused to let the crew come back. Rather than find a new location or make do with the footage he had Fincher decided to build his own Swedish dock.Which is why on a latesummer afternoon were standing on a Los Angeles soundstage examining a replica of a ruralScandinavia miseenscne mossy rocks foliagefat trees andperched high above the docks turtlenecking out of the woodsa squat deceptively cozy faux cottage. Like most sets it looks a bit weird naked. But once the lights hit and the smoke drifts in we are suddenly in the land of stunted summers and moderately high suicide rates.The mass murder and hatesex in Dragon Tattoo is proof that your mom has been reading some weird stuff lately.As usual though Fincher is not satisfied. He stands in the middle of the stage arms folded a coffee stirrer clenched in his teeth. Hes 49 and trim dressed in dark jeans a gray polo and sneakers his mouth framed by a neat turf of mostly salty saltandpepper whiskers. He then starts pacing the set calmly relaying what needs to be changed tuneups that range from the subtle to the barely perceptible a branch thats sagging a few inches too low a pair of lightbulbs with mismatched wattages a patch of leaves that needs to be a little bit darker.Most viewers wont notice the way the pebbles are scattered or how high the watermarks rise on the fake rocks. But Fincher will. Even in an industry full of control freaks Fincher stands out as obsessivea guy who will scrutinize and engineer every element in the frame until the images on the screen fit the ones in his head. Sometimes that means repainting a few leaves sometimes it means doing 50 60 even 100 takes of a single scene.Dragon Tattoo is Finchers ninth film in two decades. And while the movies often focus on darkhearted subjectsmadness Se7en paranoia The Game nihilism Fight Club greed Panic Room obsession Zodiac and betrayal The Social Networktheyre always beautiful to look at. Each is packed with so much careful detailphysical aural spatialwhile also being so clean and composed that hes earned his own fanboybestowed sobriquet Fincheresque.Like middle class and pornography the term is knowitwhenyouseeit elastic but its usually pinned on a scene thats darkly lit darkly themed and eerily beautiful. Think of the flashlights sabering through a shutins filthy apartment in Se7en or the skyscrapers exploding and folding like glass accordions at the end of Fight Club.Moments like these have established Fincher as one of Hollywoods few accessible auteurs a guy who can make commercially viable movies without 2s in their title and who never sacrifices his artful cynicism for phony uplift. There arent a whole lot of directors trying to find the balance between commerce andloath as I am to say itart Se7en writer Andrew Kevin Walker says. Somehow he manages to make something incredibly handcrafted and heartfelt on a big budget.But Finchers bleak yet captivating visions might also be why despite all his success hes never had an Inceptionsize boxoffice smash. Even a movie like Se7en which pulled in 300 million worldwide had the aura of a cult hit if only because it felt weird to enthuse openly about a movie in which a pregnant womans decapitated head is stuffed into a box. My whole career has been pervy books pervy scripts Fincher says only half kidding. It wasnt so much about finding a niche. It just didnt seem to me like there was any need to be doing more of what everyone else was doing. Its not that Finchers films arent belovedthey areits just that sometimes it take a while for audiences to come around to them. Its as if Fincher lives in the near future releasing movies a year or two before the world is ready for them.Alien3Finchers first feature. It started filming without a final script and was ultimately recut by the studio.Photo Everett CollectionAlien 3Photo Everett CollectionSE7ENFincher refused to soften the infamous ending. Brutal then today it wouldnt be out of place on CSI.Photo Everett CollectionSE7ENPhoto Everett CollectionThe GamePhoto Everett CollectionFight ClubThough it scared off theatergoers the bruising anticonsumerism tale became a DVD smash.Photo Everett CollectionFight ClubPhoto Everett CollectionPanic Room Fincher used a 3Dmodeling tool to choreograph every sequence of his taut homeinvasion thriller.Photo Everett CollectionPanic RoomPhoto Everett CollectionZodiacThe newsroom culture in the gritty film was inspired partly by Finchers father a journalist.Photo Everett CollectionZodiacPhoto Everett CollectionThe Curious Case of Benjamin ButtonPhoto Everett CollectionThe Social NetworkThe Facebook drama took in nearly 100 million domestically and won Fincher a second Oscar nomination. Photo Everett Collection Anders Linden Baldur BragasonThe Girl With The Dragon TattooFincher began developing his CGintensive fable almost seven years before its release.Photo Everett CollectionThe Girl With The Dragon TattooPhoto Everett CollectionIt wasnt until The Curious Case of Benjamin Button in 2008 and The Social Network in 2010 that Fincher made what could truly be called massmarket films. While neither was exactly upbeatBenjamin Button is the story of a man aging in reverse and The Social Networks IPOsbeforebros maneuverings and legal takedowns were as brutal as anything in Fight Clubthey were audiencepleasing efforts and both earned Fincher Oscar nominations for best director.Now with Dragon Tattoo Fincher is going further plugging into a presold globally recognizable megaproperty. Stieg Larssons densely written in every sense of the word yet hardtoputdown thriller follows a disgraced journalist played by Daniel Craig and an outcast hacker The Social Networks Rooney Mara as they team up to investigate a 40yearold missingpersons case. Before its over theyll have discovered a warped fiefdom of mass murder and hatesex and youll have discovered that your mom has been reading some really weird shit lately.In many ways Dragon Tattoo is the biggest movie of Finchers career. Its the first time since his debutAlien3that he has committed himself to a fanatically awaited popculture property Larssons novels are easily the most feverishly devoured books since the Twilight series. If the movie works Fincher could very well be looking at his first franchise not to mention a third Oscar nomination. Sony optioned Craig and Mara for the second and third installments though Fincher hasnt been announced yet as their director. Most important the movie could finally nudge Fincher into the realm of Spielberg and Scorsesebankable filmmakers who can define and mine the zeitgeist simultaneously and who get to do whatever they want. And for Fincher getting to do whatever he wants is worth going to war for.I meet Fincher at a very strange time in his life in part because hes allowing me to meet him at all. Even as Se7en and The Game became hits in the mid to late 90sright around the time when directors like Quentin Tarantino and Paul Thomas Anderson were becoming auteur superstarsFincher kept a determinedly low profile. I dont enjoy doing interviews because I dont like being part of the noise he tells me one afternoon as we drive between Dragon Tattoos LA sets. I just dont want to be grist for the mill.In person Fincher is casually friendly. He says dude and peace more than youd expect and says fuck about as often as youd expect considering hes trying to get a massively expensive tentpole movie into theaters by Christmas. And like his films Fincher is unexpectedly almost disruptively funny at one point while scouting a new location in LA he dryly jokes that private trailers will be needed for the actors because of Craigs chronic masturbation habit. Craig for his part calls the director very witty. Its a valve that needs letting off especially when youre doing scenes about anal rape.As a result of Finchers low visibilityand perhaps this was partly intendedhe has maintained a sort of scarywunderkind mystique. The few known facts about the director make him seem such an unbelievable prodigy that even today they are like the stuff of fan fiction that he lived down the street from George Lucas. Or that he skipped college and found a job at Industrial Light  Magic working on movies like Return of the Jedi. Or that by his early twenties he was already overseeing video shoots with majorlabel budgets and giant crews.But it all happened. And when you look at how Fincher grew upin Marin County California in the early 70ssuddenly its hard to imagine it not happening. By then so many directors had set up shop in the San Francisco areaLucas Francis Ford Coppola Philip Kaufman Invasion of the Body Snatchers Michael Ritchie The Candidatethat filmmaking seemed like a plausible even admirable career path. None of the kids in my neighborhood wanted to be doctors or lawyers he says. They all wanted to be moviemakers.Finchers father was an author and a bureau chief for Life magazine his mother was a mentalhealth nurse who worked in a methadone clinic. At home theyd discuss their work with Fincher. My parents didnt keep much from me he says. They were like Heres the world youre going out into.They also encouraged their son to follow his singular precociously realized goal to make movies. In the third grade Fincher was already taking an elementaryschool film class a few years later he was directing super8 movies with his friends. Figuring film school would be a waste of time he worked his way into a job at ILM in 1982 when he was 20. He knew what he wanted remembers Terry Chostner an ILM vet who was on staff with Fincher. He kept telling people he was going to be a director. And this from a kid who wasnt even drinking age.Fincher made his transition to directing by moving to LA to work in the nascent and largely lookeddownupon musicvideo industry. One of his earliest efforts was Rick Springfields Bop Til You Drop a Mad Maxcribbing dystopicJazzercise fantasy that involved slave labor alien overlords and laser beams. Though the clips ominous story line was completely incongruous with the songs probop message the video established many of the hallmarks of Finchers early directorforhire career lightbathed visuals budgetstraining production values and a linear if only quasilogical narrative.Fincher didnt have much love for music videos and he especially loathed doing commercials and still does though sometimes he will make onetheyre awful he says and they involve all sorts of bizarre bureaucratic checks and balancesbut each assignment got him one step closer to making movies and the money was spectacular.David Fincher stubborn dark obsessive.Photo Merrick MortonAfter cofounding the famed production company Propaganda Films which went on to produce works by directors from Michael Bay to Spike Jonze Fincher directed dozens of clips throughout the 80s and early 90s each increasingly daring and expensive Madonnas Express Yourself a sweatglistened rainsoaked homage to Fritz Langs Metropolis Aerosmiths Janies Got a Gun a disturbing childabuse tale with a policeprocedural story line and Don Henleys The End of the Innocence a crisp blackandwhite portrait of Reaganera hardship influenced by photographer Robert Franks famed 50s travelogue The Americans. Theres always been a deep humanism to Davids work says director Greg Gold one of Propagandas founders. Even the characters in his music videos had depth.Finchers Propaganda duties often required him to deal with label brass and ad agencies something he didnt enjoy particularly when they got in the way of his ideas. An ad exec might show up at a Fincher shoot and find out he was banned from his own set. Nosy recordlabel employees were circumvented or simply ignored. He was opinionated and difficult says Sigurjn Sighvatsson another of Propagandas founders. But he wasnt arrogant. He was confident. Kim Dempster who helped produce several of Finchers early projects remembers the shoots as being extremely stressful. You had to have it together for him. It was much harder than working for other directors but it was a much better product.When I mention an early 90s Advertising Age article about his supposed strongheadedness Fincher dismisses the claimthough he doesnt exactly deny it either. Youre supposed to have an idea of what it is youre trying to do right he says. Arent you being overpaid to have that My job is to know what the fuck I want.Finchers headquarters is a neatly outfitted modernist building in Los Angeles Little Armenia district. Inside his office theres a Where the Wild Things Are  skateboard a massive coffee table book dedicated to Stanley Kubricks neverfilmed Napoleon biopic and a Segway. On his desk is a blackandwhite printout of a scantily clad Mara the actress playing the hacker in Dragon Tattoo with a computer mouse covering her genitals. Fincher wonders if it might work to illustrate this story.What are your bosses like he asks. Are they corporate suckasses afraid of their own shadowAt first it might seem odd that Fincher would still be raging at corporate suckassery His advertising clients have included such behemoths as ATT and Levis and unlike many of his contemporariesSteven Soderbergh David O. Russellhes never made a movie outside of the studio system. He has certainly been well compensated by the corporate fat cats he claims to loathe at one point in the mid80s he says Propaganda was billing nearly 80 million a year. Undoubtedly a reasonable portion of that ended up in his pocket.Perhaps Fincher clings to his deep antiauthority streak because it has always served as a crucial motivatoralmost a muse. It started back in grade school when he bristled at the idea of being required to study nonfilm subjects and it continued through his video and commercial career. He was always a rebel Propagandas Sighvatsson says. He was always fighting with somebody whether it was the establishment or whatever. Always challenging the status quo.But whatever animosity Fincher harbored toward corporate power was surely cemented by his experiences making Alien3. Released in 1992 Finchers first movie tells the story of Sigourney Weavers beloved Ripley character being stranded in an allmale outer space penal colony where she shaves her head learns shes pregnant with an alien and eventually kills herself by falling slow motion into a giant vat of molten lava. Alien3 was pounded by critics and largely ignored by audiences the only way it could have done worse would have been if theyd actually called it AllMale Outer Space Penal Colony.Fincher hates talking about Alien3 which started filming without a finished script and plunged him into daily battles with 20th Century Fox over control in the end the studio recut Finchers version. At midnight hed have to get on the phone with Fox and justify shooting the next days work remembers Weaver. I think it hurt his feelings and was exhausting.Several years later Fincher made nice with Fox and somehow persuaded the studio to bankroll Fight Club his caustic anticorporate buddy comedy about an unnamed culturally emasculated claims adjuster Edward Norton and a charismatic anarchist named Tyler Durden Brad Pitt who form an underground brawling leagueterrorist coop. Adapted from a novel by Chuck Palahniuk Fight Club was grotesquely violent unnervingly kinetic and darkly funny. The mere existence of Fight Club is kind of a jokea treatise on the neutering effects of corporate America underwritten by an international media conglomerate. We were making a satire Fincher says. We were saying This is as serious about blowing up buildings as The Graduate is about fucking your moms friend.Released in 1999 the movie caused a bipartisan freakout Conservatives condemned its violence while Hollywood liberals complained that it focused unwanted attention on shootemup films and TV in the months following Columbine. For Fincher this was all a point of pride. Theres a quote from a film critic that David had enlarged framed and hung in his conference room says Social Network writer Aaron Sorkin. It calls Fight Club amoral and Godless. I think hed rather have that quote than a Palme dOr.Though Fight Club was only a modest success in theaters it has sold millions of DVDs. Watch the movie now and its easy to see why Fight Club has yet to age indeed its time may still not have truly arrived. The movie addressed buildyourlifearoundourbrand consumerism well before the cult of the iPod was founded and it provided an inadvertent blueprint for the sort of decentralized shitsandgiggles anarchy that would later be adopted by web collectives like Anonymous. When people watch it 50 years from now theyll probably assume it was made in 2011 or 2021 or whatever bleak period it will have turned out to presage.Fight Club also exemplifies Finchers curious relationship with the modern era Its a movie about the perils of IKEA furniture and luxe gadgetry directed by a Segwayriding gearhead. This is a paradox that runs through Finchers life and work. Hes a director raised on CG whos known for embracing new techniques and effects from the reverseaging wizardry in Benjamin Button to the subtle Winklevoss headswaps in The Social Network. Yet Fincher has never been sucked too deeply into the whimsyindulging physics bending cartoon rabbit hole of CGI that has engulfed directors like Tim Burton and George Lucas. And while his characters are frequently analytical brainiacs hackers coders claims adjusters theyre often also prisoners of modernity.Consider Panic Room in which Jodie Fosters character takes refuge inside a Sharper Imageindebted high tech steel sarcophagus. Or  The Social Network which contrasted Mark Zuckerbergs frictionless online communication with his fractured reallife friendships. Even the solitary decadeslong hunt for a serial killer in Zodiac can be seen as a cautionary tale about informational fixationan allegorical warning for the Internet age when a timesuck can become a lifesuck without your even noticing. In Finchers world the innovations that safeguard and enrich us are also the ones that do us in.Back on the set of The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Maras angryhacker character Lisbeth is having her way with a treacherous Swede courtesy of an imposingly huge chrome vibrator with a serrating buzz that sounds less like a joy machine than an irked Taser. This is Finchers third attempt at the books infamous raperevenge scene one of the key plot points in Larssons story.As it turns out Im not supposed to be here Because the scene is so intense this is a closed setlimited to essential cast and crew only. Before walking me in Fincher makes me promise not to tell Mara Im on set then promptly finds me a seat right next to hers. I cant help but wonder if its a semiplayful attempt to unnerve me. He denies this later though Im not sure I believe him. He is quite mischievous Mara says a few weeks afterward laughing. But we were all pretty desensitized at that point.Fincher thought film school would be a waste of time. Instead of going to college he worked his way into a job at ILM.The relatively atease atmosphere on the Dragon Tattoo set is surprising not only because of the subject matter but because stories of Finchers endurancetest directing style are legendary How he made Jake Gyllenhaal perform in Zodiac with a high fever how he put Mara and Jesse Eisenberg through more than 90 takes of The Social Networks opening breakup scene. Challenging people Mara says is one of his greatest joys in life.Finchers reasoning for putting his actors and crew through so many takes is simple Making a movie requires flying people thousands of miles putting them up in hotels and spending days building sets. Whats the point of all that preparation if youre just going to do your scene three timesAs grueling as it might seem to work under Fincher he inspires loyalty among many of his actors and crew members. Rigidity after all also doubles as structure. When youre working with somebody you trust theres a really nice feeling of just submitting to their goals says Eisenberg who got an Oscar nomination for his role in The Social Network.This confidence isnt limited to actors. He really is the best technician Ive ever worked with ever says Jodie Foster who has directed four films. He knows more about making movies than anybody Ive ever met. He pretty much knows everybody elses job better than they do.Still at times Fincher has played God a bit too ferociously. At one point while filming Panic Rooma production so tense according to Finchers DVD commentary that some people freaked out and needed to be escorted off the set Fincher wont get into specificsFoster stood with him behind a monitor watching him agonize over each take. He looked at me and he was like I just dont know anymore she says. Im like You know what I usually see what youre going for. This time I dont see the difference between take two and take seven. And hes like Oh my God. Im crazy arent I He recognizes it. He knows he has an issue. But he has to be 100 percent comfortable with the scene.Fortunately perhaps for Finchers current cast members there hasnt been quite as much time for such micromanaging on Dragon Tattoo. Its his fourth film in five years and it came together rather quicklysurprising given its many ostensible obstacles. For starters theres the fact that film versions of Larssons three Girl books have already been produced in Sweden and are readily available on Netflix. And the movie came with an unwigglable holidayseason deadline.There was also the material itself a return to the gritty settings of Finchers early career. I try to choose things that arent a rehash of places Ive been he says. But I liked the idea of these two people navigating this odd world thousands of miles away. That was more interesting to me than the notion of Oh look more depravity.And hooooo boy is the Dragon Tattoo book depraved sample sentence The killer concluded his barbarities by shoving a parakeet up her vagina. Its also unevenly written. For the first 100 pages or so its almost impossible to believe Larssons series has become a top choice for bookclubbers and frequentfliers around the world.But oddly enough once you finish it you cant wait to see the movie. Maybe its the animosityflecked charge between the lead characters or the monstrous yet recognizably human villainy or the way it makes computer hacking seem like such a weirdly sexy calling. Theres something undeniably dank and alluring about Dragon Tattoo something almost  Fincheresque. With its sunless settings multipronged cruelty and emotionally bruised tech addicts its impossible to imagine any other director making it.In fact Larssons gruesome work might never have found such a huge audience if Fincher hadnt long ago snipped off our eyelids and shown us the entrenched nastiness around us. Fifteen years earlier he would have had to fight to make a film as twisted as Dragon Tattoo now its set to be a holiday blockbuster. David Finchers future it seems has finally arrived.Its an early morning in Hollywood and Fincher is listening to the words of a ghostIf a dove is the sinners offering the priest shall wring off its head cleave its wings and burn it upon the altar.Were in a sound studio where dialog for Dragon Tattoo is being recorded. In the corner of the room standing at a microphone is Moa Garpendal a fairskinned longstemmed Swedish actress who plays Harriet the teenager whose mysterious disappearance sets Dragon Tattoo in motion. As she reads the linea short bit of voiceover that appears halfway through the storyFincher paces the floor making eye contact only when he has a suggestion.A little more finality at the end he says. Bring your voice down.She gives it another reading. Lets do one more Fincher says. Read it like a recipe. If you do this then you have to do this then this.More tries more notes.Give me a little more wring off and cleave just to make it more punitive.Try to make the inhale a little bit softer.Good. Do one more.Sometimes Fincher raises his glasses and pinches his eyes closed shutting out everything but the sound. Whatever hes listening for this morning whatever way the words fall together in his head will not be arrived at quickly. At one point he catches a noise deep in the background of the track and halts the session. Are you hearing that Fincher asks the room. It was like a truck passing.They listen. There doesnt seem to be anything there.Maybe Im having a stroke Fincher says shrugging. Lets do one more.They try again the words rising into the air over and over again finally landing somewhere only David Fincher can hear them.Contributing editor Brian Raftery brianraftery gmail.com wrote about TV producer Dan Harmon in issue 19.10.Go Back to Top.
